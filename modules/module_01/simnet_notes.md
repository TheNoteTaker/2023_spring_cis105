# Search and The Search Pane

Search (formerly named Smart Lookup) is a research feature in Word that enables
you to search for information on the internet without leaving Word. This feature
uses Bing, an internet search engine, to find information about a selected word
or words in a document without leaving the application.

The Search pane displays information from the internet about the words you
select or type. You have options to refine the search and to find additional
information about search results.

# Editor Pane

When finalizing a document, proofread it one last time and use the Editor pane
to check an entire document for potential spelling and grammatical errors. The
Editor pane also provides suggestions for clarity, conciseness, formality,
punctuation conventions, and vocabulary.

**Office 365/2021 Note:** The Editor pane and how it checks spelling and grammar
may differ slightly between the different versions of Office. The Editor button
[Review tab, Proofing group] may be named Spelling & Grammar.

The Editor pane is contextual. The label below the Editor pane title (Spelling,
Grammar, or Clarity and Conciseness) and the available options change depending
on whether Word detects a potential spelling or grammatical error.
