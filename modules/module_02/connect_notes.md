# General Notes

# The Internet and the Web

- The internet was launched in 1969 when the United States funded a project that
  developed a national computer network called **Advanced Research Project 
  Agency Network (ARPANET)**.
- **WWW** stands for **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb
- The web was introduced in 1991. Prior, the internet was all text.
  - The web allowed graphics, animations, sound, and video.

## Different Web Generations

- **Web 1.0** is defined by the use of search engines that connect everyone to
  web pages of interest.
  - Web pages were difficult to create and required a background in computers and
    programming.
- **Web 2.0** is defined by the use of social media that connect friends and
  family to social media posts about each others' lives.
- **Web 3.0** is defined by the innovation of the semantic web. The semantic web
  allows programs to identify the relationships between data.
  - Like Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant can inform a user that a flight they
    are planning to take has been delayed. This is accomplished by identifying the
    relationship between a flight scheduled on your calendar and flight  delay
    information available on the Internet.
    - The content creator is now a computer program, and the content audience is 
      a single person - the user.
- **Web 4.0** called the mobile web, is defined by the use of mobile tools that
  provide new sources of information for programs to provide users with
  information. This is an extension of Web 3.0, where programs draw
  relationships among data to assist individuals, but now the information
  available to these programs includes the information gathered by mobile
  devices.
  - For example, your cell phone can provide your current location, or your
    smartwatch can report your heart rate. A program like Apple's Siri can use
    your current location, the location of your next calendar event, and local
    traffic reports on the Internet to alert you to leave early for an
    appointment because of a traffic jam between your current location and your
    next event.

We continue to see innovations in Web 1.00 and Web 2.0 technologies even as
Web 3.0 and Web 4.00 technologies are still being incorporated into our lives.

**Web 5.0** is on the horizon-called the emotional web, this generation may
include programs that anticipate our needs based on our moods and behaviors.

- This future is not yet realized, and the specifics of Web 5.0 are still to be determined.

## Internet Vs Web

The **internet** is the physical network. It is made up of wires, cables,
satellites, and rules for exchanging information between computers connected to
the network.

- Being connected to this network is often described as being online.
- The internet connects millions of computers and resources throughout the world.

The **web** is a multimedia interface to the resources available on the Internet.

# Internet Access

## Providers

**Internet Service Providers (ISP)** are already connected to the internet and
provide a path or connection for individuals to access the Internet.

- The mose widely used commercial Internet service providers use telephone
  lines, cable, and / or wireless connections.
- Some of the best known providers in the United States are:
  - AT&T
  - Comcast
  - Sprint
  - T-Mobile
  - Verizon

Users connect to ISPs using on of a variet of connection technologies including:

- **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)**
- **Cable**
- **Wireless Modems**

## Browsers

Browsers provide access to web resources. These programs connect you to remote
computers; open and transfer files; display text, images, and multimedia; and
provide in one tool an uncomplicated interface to the internet and web
documents.

For browsers to connect to resources ,the **location** or **address** of the
resource must be specified. These addresses are called **uniform resource
locators (URLs)**. All URLs hav eat lesat two basic parts:

![](assets/urls.png)

1. The first part presents the protocl used to connect to the resource.
   - The protocol _https_ is used for web traffic and is one of the most widely
     used Internet Protocols.
2. The second part presents the **domain name**. It indicates the specific
   address where the resource is located.
   - The last part of the domain following the dot (.) is the **top-level domain
     (TLD)**, also known as the **web suffix**.
     - For example, _.com_ indicates a commercial site.

Once the browser has connected to the website, a document file is sent back to
your computer. This document typically contains **Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML)**, a markup language for displaying web pages.

The browser interprets the HTML formatting instructions and displays the
document as a **web page**.

Various technologies are used to provide highly interactive and animated
websites:

- **JavaScript**
  - language often used within HTML documents to trigger interactive features,
    such as opening new browser windows and checking information entered in online
    forms.
- **PHP**
  - Like JavaScript, a language often used within HTML documents to improve a 
    website's interactivity. 
  - Unlike JavaScript, which typically executes on the user's computer, PHP
    executes on the website's computer.
- **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**
  - Separate files referenced by, or lines inserted into, an HTML document that
    controls the appearance of a web page.
  - CSS helps ensure that related web pages have a consistent presentation or
    look.

# Web Utilities

**Web Utilities** are specialized utility programs that make the Internet and
web easier and safer to use. Some of these utilities are browser-related
programs that either become part of your browser or are executed from your
browser, while others work as separate stand-alone applications.

- Common uses for web utilities include filtering content and transferring files.

## Filters

**Filters** block access to selected sites.

- Filter programs allow parents as well as organizations to block out selected
  sites and set time limits.
- These programs can monitor use and generate reports detailing the total time
  spent on the Internet and the time spent at individual websites.

Some well-known filters:

- [Net Nanny](https://netnanny.com)
- [Qustodio Parental Control](https://qustodio.com)

  - Microsoft's onedrive and Google's Google drive
- **BitTorrent**

    downloads, unlike other transfer technologies whereby a file is copied from
    one computer on the Internet to another.
  - A single file might be located on dozes of individual computers.
  - When you download the file, each computer sends you a tiny piece of the larger
    file, making BitTorrent well suited for transferring very large files.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** and **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**
  - Allows you to efficient copy files to and from your computer across the
    Internet.
  - Frequently used for uploading changes to a website hosted by an ISP.
  - FTP has been used for decased and still remains one of the most popular 
    methods of file transfer.

  maintain your security and privacy while you are on the web.
  - These programs control spam, protect against computer viruses, provide
    filters, and much more.
  - It's more cost-efficient to buy the suite than each tool individually.
