# General Notes

# Application Software

There are two kinds of software:

- <details><summary><strong>System Software</strong></summary>works with end
  users, application software, and computer hardware to handle the majority of
  technical details.</details>
- <details><summary><strong>Application Software</strong></summary>
  End-user software and is used to accomplish a variety of tasks.</details>

Application software can be divided into three categories:

- **Mobile apps:** Applications designed for cell phones and tablets.
- **General-purpose Applications:** Includes word processing programs,
  presentation software, spreadsheets, and database management systems.
- **Specialized Applications:** Include thousands of programs that are more
  narrowly focused on specific disciplines and occupations.

## App Stores

An app store is where you can download applications to work with your mobile,
laptop, and desktop devices. Three of the best-known app stores are:

- Apple's App Store
- Google Play
- Microsoft Store

Applications are written for a particular type of device.

- For example, an app designed for Apple's iPhone will not work on a Windows
  laptop. Therefore, most app stores focus on apps for a particular type of
  device.

### More Widely Used App Stores

| Store           | Focus           | Site                          |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Apple App Store | Apple Devices   | <https://apps.apple.com>      |
| Microsoft Store | Windows Devices | <https://apps.microsoft.com>  |
| Google Play     | Android Devices | <https://play.google.com>     |
| Amazon          | Android Devices | <https://amazon.com/appstore> |

## User Interface

A **User interface** is the portion of the application that allows you to
control and to interact with the program.

- Most general purpose applications use a **graphical user interface (GUI)**
  that display elements called **icons** to represent familiar objects.

Many applications _(Microsoft applications in particular)_ use an interface
known as the **Ribbon GUI**, which changes based on the needs of the user.

- **Ribbons** replace toolbars and menus by organizing commonly used commands
  into
  sets of related activities. These activities are displayed as tabs and appear
  in the first ribbon.
- **Tabs** divide the ribbon into major actiivty areas. Each tab is then
  organized into **groups** that contain related items.
    - Some tabs, called **contextual tabs**, only appear when they are needed
      and
      anticipate the next operation to be performed by the user.
- **Galleries**, like dialog boxes, provide additional options and simplify
  choosing an option by showing the effect.

## Common Features

Some of the most common features of applications:

- Spelling and grammar checker � looks for misspelled words or grammatical
  errors.
- Alignment � centers, right-aligns, or left-aligns numbers and characters.
- Fonts and font sizes � specify the size and style of entered numbers and text.
- Character effects � provide a variety of different typefaces, such as bold or
  italics.
- Edit options � provide easy ways to edit text, such as cut, copy, and paste.
- Find and replace � searches a document for a specific word or phrase, with the
  option to replace the word or phrase with something else.

to create attractive, visually interesting presentations. They are excellent
tools to communicate a message and to persuade people.

## Spreadsheets

**Spreadsheets** organize, analyze, and graph numeric data such as budgets and
financial reports.

## Database Management Systems

A **database** is a collection of related data. It is the electronic equivalent
of a file cabinet.

A **database management system (DBMS)** or **database manager** is a program
that sets up, or structures, a database.

- It also provides tools to enter, edit, and retrieve data from the database.
- Three popular DBMS:
    - Microsoft Access
    - Apple FileMaker
    - Oracle Database Express Edition

# Specialized Applications

General-purpose applications are widely used in nearly every profession,
specialized applications are widely used within specific professions.

- Such as graphic programs and web authoring programs.

## Graphic Programs

Graphic programs are widely by professionals in the graphic arts profession.
They include:

- Video editors
- Image editing programs
- Illustration programs
    - Bitmap images use pixels to represent images
    - Vector images (vector illustrations) use geometric shapes or objects.
        - Defined by mathematical equations
- Desktop publishing programs (Page layout programs)
    - low you to mix text and graphics to create publications of professional
      quality.

## Video Game Design Software

Video game design software will help you organize your thoughts and guide you
through the game design process, including character development and
environmental design.

The video game design software behind some of the biggest games include:

- Unreal Game Engine
- Unity development kit
- GameMaker Studio 2

## Web Authoring

Creating a site is called **web authoring**.

More specialized and powerful programs, called **web authoring programs** are
typically used to create sophisticated commercial sites.

- Some web authoring programs are **WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)**,
  which means you can build a page without interacting directly with the HTML 
  code.

Widely used web authoring programs include:

- Adobe Dreamweaver
- Froala 4.0

## Other Specialized Applications
