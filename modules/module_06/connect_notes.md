# General Notes

# What Is Input

**Input** is any data or instructions entered into a computer.

- It can come directly from you or from other sources.
- You provide input whenever you use system or application programs.
    - Sending a text message from a cell phone: You enter data in the form of
      numbers and letters and issue commands such as _send message_ or _attach
      photo_.
    - You can also enter data and issue commands by pointing to items or using
      your voice.
    - Other sources of input:
        - Scanned or photographed images

**Input Devices** are hardware used to translate words, numbers, sounds, images,
and gestures that people understand into a form that the system unit can
process.

- Keyboards & Mice
- Pointing devices
- Scanning devices
- Image capturing devices
- Audio-input devices

# Keyboard Entry

Keyboards convert numbers, letters, and special characters that people
understand into electrical signals that are sent to, and processed by, the
system unit.

- Most keyboards use an arrangement of keys called QWERTY.

## Keyboards

There are three basic categories of keyboards:

- **Virtual**
    - Primarily used with cell phones and tablets.
- **Laptop**
- **Traditional**
    - The standard U.S. traditional keyboard has 101 keys.
        - Including function keys, navigation keys, and a numeric keypad.
        - Some keyboards include additional special keys _(such as the Windows
          key)_.
        - **Toggle keys** like Caps Lock turn a feature on or off.
        - **Combination Keys** like Ctrl perform an action when held down in
          combination with another key.

# Pointing Devices

**Pointing devices** provide an intuitive interface with the system unit by
accepting physical movements or gestures, such as a finger pointing or moving
across a screen, and converting these movements into machine-readable input.

There's a wide variety of pointing devices, such as:

- Touch screen
- Mouse
- Game controller

## Touch Screens

Touch screens allow users to select actions or commands by touching a screen
with a finger or stylus.

- **Stylus:** A pen-like device typically used with tablets and mobile devices.
    - A stylus often interacts with the computer through handwriting recognition
      software.
- **Multi-touch screens** can be touched with more than one finger.

## Mice

- A **mouse** controls a pointer that is displayed on the monitor.
- The **mouse pointer** usually appears in the shape of an arrow but frequently
  changes shape, depending on the application.
- Mice communicated detected movement through a cord or wirelessly through
  either radio waves or infrared light waves to communicate with the system
  unit.

## Game Controllers

- **Game controllers** are devices that provide input to computer games.

Keyboards and traditional mice can be used as game controllers, but the four
most popular and specialized game controllers are:

- **Joysticks**
    - Control game actions by users varying the pressure, speed, and direction
      of
      a control stick.
- **Gaming mice**
    - Similar to traditional mice with higher precision, faster responsiveness,
      and programmable buttons.
- Gamepads (like remote controllers for game consoles)
    - Designed to be held by two hands and provide a wide array of inputs,
      including motion, turning, stopping, and firing.
    - I.e. Console remote controllers
- Motion-sensing devices
    - Control games by user movement.
    - I.e. Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers

## Privacy

- Smart thermostats and smart refrigerators include microphones.
- Smart devices constantly listen to and record our conversations, sending
  them to researchers and scientists for analysis and study.

# Scanning Devices

Scanning devices convert scanned text and images into a form that the system
unit can process.

There are five types of scanning devices:

- Optical scanners
- Card readers
- Bar code readers
- RFID readers
- Character and mark recognition devices

## Optical Scanners

- Also known as just a **scanner**.
- Scanners accept documents consisting of text and/or images and converts them
  to machine-readable form.
    - They do not recognize individual letters or images.
    - They recognize light, dark, and colored areas that make up individual
      letters or images.
    - Scanned documents are saved in files that can be further processed,
      displayed, printed, or stored for later use.

There are four basic types of optical scanners:

- **Flatbed Scanner**
    - Like a copy machine.
    - Image to be scanned is placed on a glass surface, adn the scanner records
      the image.
- **Document Scanner**
    - Similar to flatbed scanner except that it can quickly scan multi-page
      documents.
    - Automatically feeds one page of a document at a time through a scanning
      surface.
- **Portable Scanner**
    - Handheld device that slides across the image, making direct contact.
- **3D Scanner**
    - Uses lasers, cameras, or robotic arms to record the shape of an object.
    - Unlike 2D scanners, most 3D scanners cannot recognize light, dark, and
      colored areas.
    - 3D scanners recognize the shape of the object they are scanning.

## Card Readers

- **Card readers** interpret encoded information that is stored on cards.
- The most common type of card reader is the **magnetic card reader**.
    - The encoded information is stored on a thin magnetic strip located on the
      back of the card.
    - The information is read when the card is swiped through the magnetic card
      reader.
- Many credit cards, known as **chip cards**, include additional security in
  the form of a microchip embedded in the credit card.
    - This chip contains encrypted data that makes it nearly impossible for
      criminals to forge a duplicate card.

## Bar Code Readers

- **Bar code readers** or **scanners** are often either handheld **wand
  readers** or **platform scanners**.
- Bar code readers contain photoelectric cells that scan or read **bar codes**,
  or the vertical zebra-striped marks printed on product containers.

There are a variety of codes, including:

- **UPCs (Universal Product Codes)**
    - Widely used by retail stores to automate the processes to check out
      customers, to change product prices, and to maintain inventory records.
- **MaxiCode**
    - Widely used by the United Parcel Service (UPS) and others to automate the
      process of routing packages, tracking in-transit packages, and locating
      lost
      packages.

## RFID Readers

**RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags** are tiny chips that can be
embedded in almost everything.

- These chips contain electronically stored information that can be read using
  an **RFID reader** located several yards away.
- Widely used to monitor and locate lost pets, track food from farm to table,
  and to record prices, product descriptions, and locations of retail items.

## Character and Mark Recognition Devices

Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that are able to recognize
special characters and marks.

- Specialty devices that are essential tools for certain applications.

The three types are:

- **Magnetic-ink Character Recognition (MICR)**
    - A special-purpose machine known as a reader/sorter reads these numbers and
      provides input that allows banks to efficiently maintain customer account
      balances.
    - Used by banks to automatically read those unusual numbers on the bottom of
      checks and deposit slips.
- **Optical-character Recognition (OCR)**
    - Uses special preprinted characters that can be read by a light source and
      changed into machine-readable code.
    - A common OCR device is the handheld wand reader, used in department stores
      to read retail price tags by reflecting light on the printed characters.
- **Optical-mark Recognition (OMR)**
    - Senses the presence or absence of a mark, such as a pencil mark.
    - OMR is often used to score standardized multiple-choice tests.

# Image-Capturing Devices

Optical scanners can make or copy from an original. Imager-capturing devices
create or capture original images.

These include:

- **Digital Cameras**
    - Capture images digitally and store the images on a memory card or in the
      camera's memory.
    - Provide a fast and easy way to create photos to share over social media
      and
      e-mail.
- **Webcams**
    - Specialized digital video cameras that capture images and send them to a
      computer for broadcast over the internet.
    - Popular videoconferencing apps, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Apple's
      FaceTime, use webcams to allow you to communicate in real time with
      friends
      and family using live video.

# Audio-Input Devices

_Audio-input devices_ convert sounds into a form that can be processed by the
system unit.

- By far the most widely used audio-input device is the microphone.
- Audio input can take many forms, including the human voice and music

## Voice Recognition Systems

**Voice recognition systems** use a microphone, a sound card, and special
software.

- Allow users to operate computers and other devices, as well as to create
  documents, using voice commands.
- Specialized portable voice recorders are widely used by doctors, lawyers,
  and others to record dictation.

# What Is Output

**Output** is processed data or information.

- Output typically takes the form of:
    - Text
    - Graphics
    - Photos
    - Audio
    - Video
- When you create a presentation using a presentation graphics program, you
  typically input text and graphics. You also could include photographs, voice
  narration, and even video. The output would be the completed presentation,

**Output devices** are any hardware used to provide or to create output.

- They translate information that has been processed by the system unit into a
  form that humans can understand.
- There are a wide range of output devices. The most widely used are:
    - **Monitors**
    - **Printers**
    - **Audio-output Devices**

# Monitors

- Monitors are the most frequently used output devices.
- Also known as **display screens**.
- Monitors present visual images of text and graphics.
- Monitors vary in size, shape, and cost.
- Almost all monitors have basic distinguishing features.

## Features

The most important characteristic of a monitor is its **clarity**.

- **Clarity:** Refers to the quality and sharpness of the displayed images. It
  is a function of several monitor features, including:
    - **Resolution**
    - **Dot pitch**
    - **Contrast ratio**
    - **Active display area**
    - **Aspect ratio**
- Another important feature is the ability to accept touch or gesture input.
    - Not present in older monitors, although it is becoming standard in newer
      monitors.

### Resolution

- One of the most important features.
- Resolution is expressed as a grid of the series of dots or pixels that form
  images on a monitor.

| Standard |    Pixels     |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
|  HD 720  |  1280 x 720   |
| HD 1080  | 1,920 x 1,080 |
|  WQXGA   | 2,560 x 1,600 |
|  UHD 4K  | 3,840 x 2,160 |
|  UHD 8K  | 8,192 x 4,608 |

### Dot (Pixel) Pitch

- The distance between each pixel.
- The lower the dot pitch, the clearer the images.
- Most newer desktop monitors have a dot pitch below 0.30mm.
- Cell phones have dot pitches below 0.05mm since they are designed to be viewed
  more closely.

### Contrast Ratios

- Indicate a monitor's ability to display images.
- It compares the light intensity of the brightest white to the darkest black.
- The higher the ratio, the better the monitor.
- Good monitors have a contrast ratio above 1,000:1

### Active Display Area

- Size
- Measured by the diagonal length of a monitor's viewing area.
- Common sizes are:
    - 15 inches
    - 17 inches
    - 19 inches
    - 21 inches
    - 24 inches

### Aspect Ratio

- Indicates the proportional relationship between a display's width and height.
- Older, square-shaped monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio.
- Newer monitors have a 16:9 aspect ratio, designed to display widescreen
  content.

## Calibrating a Monitor

1. Warm up the TV or monitor for half an hour before calibration
2. Set the display resolution to its default (or native) resolution
3. Calibrate in a room with ambient light.
    - Direct light on the screen can make it difficult to accurately asses your
      display's picture quality.
4. Select your picture mode
    - For true color representation, look for **THX** or **ISF** modes. If those
      are not present, use **cinema** or **theater** mode.
5. Use software tools
    - Windows and macOS come with free monitor calibration tools.
    - THX Tune-up app is a premium tool you can use.

## Flat-Panel Monitors

- Most widely used monitor today.
- Compared to other types, they are thinner, more portable, and require less
  power to operate.
- Almost all are backlit, meaning that a common source of light is dispersed
  over all the pixels on the screen.

There are three types of flat-panel monitors:

- **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)**
    - Widely used for older monitors.
    - Less expensive
- **LED (Light-Emitting Diode)**
    - Use similar technology with a more advanced backlighting technology.
    - Produce better-quality images, are slimmer, and more environmentally
      friendly as they require less power and use fewer toxic chemicals to
      manufacture.
    - Most new monitors are LED.
- **OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode)**
  - Replace the LED monitor's backlighting technology with a thin layer of
    organic compound that produces light.
  - OLED monitors are even thinner, with better power efficiency and contrast
    ratios, because they eliminate the backlight.

## E-book Readers

**E-book readers (e-readers)** are dedicated mobile devices for storing and
displaying e-books and other electronic media, including electronic newspapers 
and magazines.

- Typically use **e-ink**, a technology that produces images that reflect light
  like ordinary paper, making the display easy to read.
- Two well-known e-readers:
  - Amazon's Kindle
  - Walmart's Kobo eReaders

## Other Monitors

- Some other types of monitors are used for more specialized applications, such
  as making presentations or watching television.

Some other types of monitors:

- **Digital** or **Interactive Whiteboards**
  - Specialized devices with a large display connected to a computer or 
    projector.
  - Computer's desktop is displayed on the digital whiteboard and controlled 
    using a special pen, a finger, or some other device.
  - Widely used in classrooms and corporate boardrooms.
- **Flexible Screens**
  - Allow digital devices to display images on nonflat services.
  - I.e. Cell phones with screens that wrap around the edges of the phone and 
    curved monitors whose edges wrap toward the viewer.
    - Samsung Galaxy Fold
- **Digital Projectors**
  - Project images from a traditional monitor onto a screen or wall.

# Printers

- Printers are one of the most used output devices.
- Printers translate information that has been processed by the system unit and
  present the information on paper.

## Features

Almost all printers have the following basic distinguishing features:

- **Resolution**
  - Similar to monitor resolution, it is a measure of the clarity of images
    produced.
  - Measured in **dpi (dots per inch)**.
  - Personal printers average 1,200 by 4,800 dpi.
- **Color Capability**
  - The most common black ink selection is **grayscale**, in which images are 
    displayed using many shades of gray.
- **Speed**
  - Measured in the number of pages printed per minute.
  - Personal printers average 15 to 19 pages per minute for single color (black)
    output, and 5 to 12 pages per minute for color output.
- **Memory**
  - Used to store printing instructions and documents waiting to be printed.
  - The more memory, the faster it will be able to print large documents.
- **Duplex Printing**
  - Allows automatic printing on both sides of a sheet of paper.
  - Not currently a standard feature for all printers, but will likely become
    one in the future to reduce paper waste.
- **Connectivity**
  - The ability to connect to a network, eliminating the need for a computer to
    be attached by a cable to the printer and making it easier for multiple 
    computers to share one printer.

## Inkjet Printers

- Spray ink at a high speed onto the surface of paper.
- Produces high-quality images in a variety of colors, making it ideal for
  printing photos.
- Most widely used printers.

## Laser Printers

- Use technology similar to photocopying machines.
- Use a laser light beam to produce images with excellent letter and graphics
  quality.
- More expensive than Inkjet printers.
- Used in applications requiring high-quality output.

There are two categories of laser printers:

- **Personal Laser Printers**
  - Less Expensive
  - Used by a single user
  - Can print 15 to 17 pages a minute
- **Shared Laser Printers**
  - More expensive
  - Shared by a group of users
  - Can print over 50 pages a minute
  - Support color

## 3D Printers

- Create three-dimensional shapes by adding very thin layer after layer of 
  material until the final hsape is fully formed.
  - Known as **additive manufacturing**
- Variety of different processes and materials can be used to create each layer.
  - One of the most common extrudes a liquid plastic or other substance through 
    a nozzle similar to an inject printer.
- Controlled by data describing the shape of the object to be created.
  - Typically a file created by a 3D modeling program or from scanning a 
    physical model using a 3D scanner.
- Volkswagen uses 3D printers in its production lines to produce gear knobs and
  custom tailgate lettering.

## Other Printers

- **Cloud Printers**
  - Connected to the Internet and provide printing services to others on the
    internet.
  - **Google Cloud Print** is an example that allows a user to print from 
    anywhere on any device to a printer that is activated using the Google 
    Chrome OS.
- **Thermal Printers**
  - Use heat elements to produce images on heat-sensitive paper.
  - Widely used with ATMs and gasoline pumps to print receipts.
- **Plotters**
  - Special-purpose printers for producing a wide range of specialized output.
  - Using output from graphics tablets and other graphical devices, plotters
    create maps, images, and architectural and engineering drawings.
  - Typically used by graphic artists, engineers, and architects to print out
    designs, sketches, and drawings.

# Audio-Output Devices

- Audio-output devices translate audio information from the computer into
  sounds that people can understand.
- The most widely used audio-output devices are **speakers** and **headphones**.
  - They connect to a sound card within the system unit by either cable or 
    wirelessly using **bluetooth**.
- It is much easier to create voice output than to recognize and interpret voice
  input.

# Combination Input and Output Devices

Common combination devices:

- **Headsets**
  - Combine the functionality of microphones and headphones.
  - The microphone accepts audible input and the headphones provide audio
    output.
- **Multifunctional Devices (MFD)**
  - Combine the capabilities of a scanner, printer, fax, and copy machine.
  - Less expensive than purchasing the individual components, but more likely
    to break down.
  - A device with a single purpose in mind (such as a scanner) is more likely
    to have professional-level features and perform faster than a MFD.
  - Not as reliable, because problems with one of the functional parts can make
    the entire device inoperable.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) Head-mounted Displays and Controllers**
  - Artificial, or simulated, reality created in 3D by computers.
  - **VR head-mounted displays**
    - Use earphones, stereoscopic screens to present 3D images, and gyroscopic
      sensors to interpret head orientation.
  - **VR controllers**
    - Use sensors that collect data about your hand movements coupled with 
      software.
- **Drones** or **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**
  - Take input from a radio joystick or Wii-Fi-connected tablet or laptop.
  - The drones act as an output device, sending back video and sound to the user.
  - Used in civil engineering, amateur cinematography, agriculture to apply 
    pesticides and monitor livestock, disaster relief to look for people in 
    distress, and by the post office to deliver mail.
- **Robots**
  - Use cameras, microphones, and other sensors as inputs.
  - Found everywhere, including vacuuming floors in homes, assembling cars in
    factories, and aiding surgeons in hospitals.

# Ergonomics

- **Ergonomics _(er-guh-nom-ix)_:** The study of human factors related to
  things people use.
  - Concerned with fitting the task to the user rather than forcing the user 
    to contort to do the task.

![](assets/ergonomics.png)

Other recommendations to avoid physical discomfort:

- **Eyestrain and Headache**
  - Take a 15-minute break every hour or two
  - Keep everything you're focusing on at about the same distance
  - Clean the screen of dust from time to time
- **Back and Neck Pain**
  - Make sure equipment is adjustable
  - The monitor should be at eye level or slightly below eye level
  - Use a footrest to reduce leg fatigue
- **Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)**
  - RSI is any injury caused by fast, repetitive work that can generate neck,
    wrist, hand, and arm pain.
  - **Carpal tunnel syndrome** is an example and can be avoided by getting an
    ergonomically correct keyboard.
    - Also take frequent short rest breaks and gently massage your hands

## Portable Computers

Recommendations for ergonomics with the following portable computers:

- **Cell Phones**
  - Pain occurs at the base or in the muscles of the thumb or wrist. Minimize 
    this by:
    - Keeping wrists straight (not bent)
    - Head up
    - Shoulders straight
    - Frequently resting thumbs by using other fingers
- **Tablets**
  - Pain occurs in the neck and back due to _tablet hunch_, where the user 
    improperly aligns his or her head to the viewing surface. Minimize this by:
    - Taking frequent breaks
    - Moving around while working
    - Using a tablet cover or stand that allows the screen to be tipped at 
      various angles
    - Using an external keyboard
- **Laptops**
  - It's impossible to position the keyboard or screen for safe ergonomic use.
  - To minimize the negative impact:
    - Raise the level of the screen by using books or reams of paper under the
      laptop and attach an external keyboard to be used at waist level.

# Careers In IT

**Technical writers** prepare instruction manuals, technical reports, and other
scientific or technical documents. 

- Most technical writers work for computer software firms, government agencies,
  or research institutions. 
- They translate technical information into easily understandable instructions
  or summaries. 
- As new technology continues to develop and expand, the need for technical
  writers who can communicate technical expertise to others is expected to
  increase.
- Typically require an Associates or Bachelor's degree in communications, 
  journalism, or English and a specialization in, or familiarity with, a 
  technical field.
