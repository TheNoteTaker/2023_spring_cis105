# Privacy

Privacy concerns the collection and use of data about individuals. With the
digital revolution, new tools such as cell phones provide camera, microphone,
and sensors to share every experience with the world. However, this presents new
challenges to old ways of thinking about privacy.

## Three primary privacy issues:

1. Accuracy: The responsibility of those who collect data to ensure that the
   data is correct.
2. Property: Who owns the data.
3. Access: The responsibility of those who have data to control who is able to
   use that data.

# Big Data

**Big data** refers to the unprecedented amount of digital information being
stored, including almost all human events recorded digitally. The collection of
data can be searched to find all the actions of one person, creating a **digital
footprint** that reveals a highly detailed account of their life.

## Information resellers

An industry of data gatherers known as **information resellers** or
**information brokers** exists that collects, analyzes, and sells personal data.
This personal data can reveal more than what one might wish to make public and
have an impact beyond what one might imagine.

## Three important issues related to digital footprints:

1. **Collecting public, but personally identifying, information:** Google's
   Street View project allows anyone in the world to view detailed images of
   individuals, their homes, or vehicles. Such a combination of computing
   technologies could make real-time tracking of individuals in public places
   possible.

2. **Spreading information without personal consent:** Employers use social
   networking profiles to make decisions about hiring, placement, promotion, and
   firing. Social networking sites can put individuals at risk since deeper
   analysis of a social networking profile may reveal even more about the
   individual than they intend.

3. **Spreading inaccurate information:** Errors in credit history or giving
   someone a serious criminal history can happen due to simple clerical errors.

Mistaken identity is when the digital footprint of one person is switched with
another. The Freedom of Information Act allows individuals to gain access to
records held by credit bureaus and government agencies. Portions may be deleted
for national security reasons.

# Community

Sharing personal information on social media is a necessary part of creating and
participating in an online community. However, many individuals do not fully
understand the complex sharing and privacy policies of these networks. This
often causes unintentional sharing with people outside their intended social
circle. Social networks have come under fire from privacy groups, who say that
these companies use complex settings and policies to get users to share more
information than intended. This information is in turn shared with advertisers.

# Private Networks

Employee-monitoring software is commonly used to record virtually everything
employees do on their work computers and networks. Employees should never do
anything on a work computer or a work network connection that they wouldn’t want
shared with their employer.

## Concept Check

- Big data can affect our privacy by creating a digital footprint that reveals a
  highly detailed account of our life. Information resellers exist that collect,
  analyze, and sell such personal data.

  but personally identifying, information, spreading information without
  personal consent, and spreading inaccurate information. Mistaken identity is

## The Internet and the Web

### Privacy Concerns and Illusion of Anonymity

- Many people believe that they are anonymous when using the internet and that
  little can be done to invade their personal privacy, but this is an illusion.
- Every computer on the internet is identified by a unique IP address, which can
  be used to trace internet activities to their origin.
- Deep web websites can allow communication in a secure and anonymous manner,
  and the dark web can hide a user’s IP address, attracting criminals and
  political activists.

### Browsing and Privacy

- Browsers store critical information, including **history** and **temporary
  internet files**, which can be used to quickly redisplay web content.
    - **History files** include the locations, or addresses, of sites that you
      have recently visited.
    - **Temporary Internet files**, also known as the **browser cache**, contain
      web page content and instructions for displaying this content.
- **Cookies**, which are small data files, can store information about a user's
  preferences and browsing habits and can be used by websites to deliver a
  personalized experience.
- **First-party cookies** are generated and read by the website being visited,
  while **third-party** cookies are generated by an advertising company
  affiliated with the website and used to track a user's web activity.
- Google Chrome's Incognito mode erases records of web activities on the user's
  computer but not on the computers running the websites visited.

### Privacy Threats

- **Web bugs**, which are invisible images or HTML code, can transmit
  information
  without a user's knowledge, making it possible to identify active e-mail
  addresses.
- **Spyware** is software designed to secretly record and report a user's
  activities
  on the internet, including keystrokes and personal information.
- **Computer monitoring software** is perhaps the most invasive and dangerous
  type of spyware.
- Such as **keyloggers**.
- **Antispyware** or spy removal programs can detect and remove various types of
  privacy threats.

#### Anti-spyware Programs

| Program          | Website                        |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------|
| Ad-Aware         | <www.adaware.com>              |
| Norton Security  | <www.norton.com>               |
| Windows Defender | <www.microsoft.com>            |
| AVG Antitrack    | [avg.com](https://www.avg.com) |

### Ethics

- Data encryption protects privacy but also allows criminals to hide evidence
  from police, leading to debates about whether governments should have a way to
  bypass encryption.

## Online Identity

- Online identity is the information that people voluntarily post about
  themselves online and is available indefinitely to anyone who cares to look.
- People have lost jobs due to posts on social networking sites, highlighting
  the potential consequences of online identity.

## Major Laws on Privacy

- Federal laws such as the **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act**, **Health Insurance
  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**, and **Family Educaitonal Rights
  and Privacy Act (FERPA)** protect personal financial, medical, and educational
  information, respectively.

## Conclusion

Internet privacy is a complex issue with various threats and challenges. While
there are federal laws in place to protect personal information, much of the
data collected by private organizations is not covered. Users must exercise
caution when browsing and consider the potential consequences of their online
identity. Encryption provides privacy but also poses challenges for law
enforcement. Antispyware programs and other tools can help protect against
privacy threats.

# Security

Personal security protects us from crime and danger in the physical world. To
protect ourselves from new threats, computer security needs to protect our
information, hardware, and software from unauthorized use, as well as preventing
or limiting the damage from intrusions, sabotage, and natural disasters.

## Cybercrime

Cybercrime or computer crime is any criminal offense that involves a computer
and a network. It was estimated that cybercrime affects over 400 million people
and costs over $400 billion each year. Cybercrimes can take various forms,
including:

### Identity Theft

- Illegal assumption of someone’s identity for the purposes of economic gain.
- Stolen identities are used to steal credit cards and mail and to commit other
  crimes.
- Identity thieves stole $16 billion and victimized 15.4 million individuals.

### Internet Scams

- Scams using the Internet and have created financial and legal problems for
  many thousands of people.
- Almost all the scams are initiated by a mass mailing to unsuspecting
  individuals.
- Common types of Internet scams include phishing, advanced fee scam, greeting
  card scam, bank loan/credit card scam, and lottery scam.

#### Common Internet Scams

|            Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          Phishing          | Communications in which a criminal pretends to be from an official organization and tricks you into giving them sensitive data, such as passwords, bank account numbers, etc. Often these communications include a link to a website that looks like an official log-in screen but in fact is a fake website designed to trick people into giving up their username and password. |
|      Advancedfee scam      | A classic e-mail scam. The recipient receives an e-mail from a wealthy foreigner in distress who needs your bank account information to safely store his or her wealth, and for your troubles you will receive a large amount of money. Of course, once the scammer has your bank account information, your accounts will be drained and he or she will disappear.                |
|     Greeting card scam     | An e-mail or social media communication informs you that a friend has sent you a greeting card and you need to download software to view it. In fact, the software is malware that can steal your data and infect your computer.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bank loan/credit card scam | Criminals acting as bank or credit card officials offer you unusually good deals on bank loans or credit cards—but these are just attempts to get you to pay huge “processing fees” and to get your personal information.                                                                                                                                                         |
|        Lottery scam        | An e-mail informs you that you have won the lottery and to claim your prize, you need to pay processing fees. Criminals will take the processing fees, but you will not receive any lottery winnings.                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Data Manipulation

- Unauthorized access of a computer network and copying files to or from the
  server.
- Unlike other cybercrimes, data manipulation can occur for months, even years,
  without the victims being aware of the security breach, making it hard to
  detect.

### Ransomware

- Malicious software that encrypts your computer’s data and ransoms the password
  to the user.
- Ransomware criminals have targeted food processing plants, hospitals, and
  police stations, endangering the health and safety of millions.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

- Attempt to slow down or stop a computer system or network by flooding it with
  requests for information and data.
- Targets are usually ISPs and specific websites, resulting in shutting down the
  servers at the ISP or the website and unable to respond to legitimate users.

### Tips

Identity theft is a growing problem and can be financially devastating if you
are a victim. Here are some steps to help protect your identity:

1. Be careful what you post on the Internet. Never post personal information on
   forums or social networking areas that are public or in response to an e-mail
   from someone you do not know or trust.
2. Only do business on the Internet with companies you know to be legitimate.
3. When selling a computer, be sure to completely remove all personal
   information from the hard drive. To ensure that your personal information is
   erased, consider using a free erasure software tool, such
   as [Dban](https://dban.org).
4. Monitor your credit. Each year, you are entitled to a free personal credit
   report from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. Monitor your
   credit by requesting a report every four months from a different reporting
   agency. The official site for this service is <www.annualcreditreport.com>.

### Conclusion

As technology continues to advance, cybercrime will continue to be a growing
problem. It is important to protect ourselves by being aware of the various
types of cybercrime, taking steps to protect our personal information, and
monitoring our accounts and credit reports. Understanding the tools used by
cybercriminals can also help us make smarter choices and better protect
ourselves from becoming victims.

## Social Engineering

- Manipulating people to divulge private data
- Often the least secure parts of a network or computer are the humans who work
  with it
- Common techniques include phishing, where Internet users are tricked into
  divulging their financial information by a fake but official-looking website
  or e-mail

## Malicious Software

- **Cracker:** a computer criminal who creates and distributes malicious
  programs or malware
- **Malware:** specifically designed to damage or disrupt a computer system
- Three most common types of malware:
    - **Viruses:** migrate through networks and operating systems, and mostly
      attach themselves to other programs and databases
    - **Worms:** replicate themselves over and over again, clogs computers and
      networks until their operations are slowed or stopped
    - **Trojan horses:** appear to be harmless but contain malicious programs,
      not viruses but can be carriers of viruses

## Malicious Hardware

- Criminals use computer hardware to steal information, infect computers with
  malicious software, and disrupt computer systems
- Most common malicious hardware includes:
    - **Zombies:** computers infected by a virus, worm, or Trojan horse that
      allows them to be remotely controlled for malicious purposes, a collection
      of zombie computers is known as a **botnet**, or **robot network**
    - **Rogue Wi-Fi hotspots:** imitate free Wi-Fi networks, capture any and all
      information sent by the users to legitimate sites, including usernames
      and passwords
    - **Infected USB flash drives:** contain viruses and other malicious
      software, typically distributed in public spaces or at conferences

### Privacy

- Some websites are designed to be hidden from standard search engines and allow
  people to communicate in a secure and anonymous manner, known as the dark web
- Dark web makes it nearly impossible to identify who is using it, attracts
  criminals who want to engage in illegal activities
- Same anonymity allows people in countries where political dissent is dangerous
  and free speech is censored to communicate, plan, and organize toward a more
  free and open society without fear of jail or execution

  typically distributed in public spaces or at conferences.

### Conclusion

- Security and privacy are important issues in the digital age.
- Social engineering, phishing, malicious software, and malicious hardware are
  common threats to our security and privacy.
- The dark web offers anonymity to those seeking to engage in illegal
  activities, but it can also provide a platform for political dissenters in
  oppressive regimes.
- To protect ourselves, it is important to stay informed about these threats and
  take appropriate measures to safeguard our information and systems.

## Measures to Protect Computer Security

Computer systems and data can be compromised in numerous ways. The
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits unauthorized persons from
accessing data using any computer across state lines, and offenders can
be sentenced up to 20 years in prison and fined up to \$100,000.
However, the best protection for computer security is to be prepared.
The following are some of the main measures to ensure computer security:

### Restricting Access

- Security experts are constantly devising ways to protect computer
  systems from access by unauthorized persons. The most common way to
  restrict access is the use of a password. Passwords are secret words
  or phrases that must be keyed into a computer system to gain access.
  For many applications on the web, users assign their own passwords.
- Security professionals warn that most people use passwords that are
  too easily guessed. Passwords should have at least eight characters,
  not include personal information, and contain at least one uppercase
  letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one symbol.
- Newer technology allows access to be restricted by passwords that do
  not require secret words or phrases, such as Picture Password or
  biometric scanning devices such as fingerprint and iris scanners.

### Ethics

- Software companies have discovered flaws in cell phone security and
  sell software that exploit these flaws and break open locked cell
  phones. However, this software is also purchased and used by
  dictators and tyrants to spy on their populace and imprison
  political dissenters. Companies that discover security flaws have an
  ethical responsibility to work with cell phone companies to
  eliminate the flaws instead of exploiting them.

### Security Suites

- Security suites provide a collection of utility programs designed to
  protect your privacy and security while on the web. Two widely used
  security suites are Avast! Free Antivirus and Microsoft Windows
  Defender. Services that keep track of viruses on a daily basis, such
  as Symantec, McAfee, and Microsoft, are also important to stay
  current with virus threats.

### Firewalls

- Act as a security buffer between a corporation’s private network and all
  external networks, including the Internet.

### Password Managers

- Password managers help you create strong passwords and store all
  your passwords in one location, automatically providing the
  appropriate password when requested. However, this master list of
  passwords is protected by one _master_ password, which, if
  forgotten or revealed, could pose a risk.

### Authentication

- **Authentication** is the process of ensuring the identity of a user.
  **Two-factor authentication** uses two types (or factors) of data to
  verify your identity, such as knowledge, possession, and biometric
  data. Two-step authentication uses one type of authentication twice.

### Encrypting Data

#### Overview

- Encryption is the process of coding information to make it unreadable except
  to those who have a special piece of information known as an encryption key or
  a key.
- Encryption is used to protect information as it moves over a network or is
  stored on a computer system.

#### Common uses for encryption include:

1. E-mail encryption
2. File encryption
3. Website encryption
4. Virtual private networks (VPNs)
5. Wireless network encryption

#### E-mail Encryption

- Protects e-mail messages as they move across the Internet.
- One of the most widely used personal e-mail encryption programs is Pretty Good
  Privacy (PGP).
- A PGP e-mail message window displays message text as a long string of letters,
  numbers, and symbols.

#### File Encryption

- Protects sensitive files by encrypting them before they are stored on a hard
  drive.
- Files can be encrypted individually or specialized software can be used to
  encrypt all files automatically each time they are saved to a certain hard
  drive location.
- Apple's File Vault is an example of file encryption software.

#### Website Encryption

- Secures web transactions, especially financial transactions.
- Web pages that accept passwords or confidential information like a credit card
  number are often encrypted.
- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the most widely used
  Internet protocol, which requires that the browser and the connecting site
  encrypt all messages, providing a safer and more secure transmission.

#### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

- Encrypt connections between company networks and remote users such as workers
  connecting from home.
- This connection creates a secure virtual connection to a company LAN across
  the Internet.

#### Wireless Network Encryption

- Restricts access to authorized users on wireless networks.
- **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access)** is the most widely used wireless network
  encryption for home wireless networks.
- **WPA2** is typically established for a wireless network through the network’s
  wireless router.

### Anticipating Disasters

#### Overview

- Companies (and even individuals) should prepare themselves for disasters.
- Physical security is concerned with protecting hardware from possible human
  and natural disasters.
- Data security is concerned with protecting software and data from unauthorized
  tampering or damage.

#### Disaster Recovery Plans

- Most large organizations have disaster recovery plans describing ways to
  continue operating until normal computer operations can be restored.

#### Preventing Data Loss

- Making frequent backups of data is essential to prevent data loss.
- Backups are often stored at an off-site location to protect data in case of
  theft, fire, flood, or other disasters.
- Incremental backups store multiple versions of data at different points in
  time to prevent data loss due to unwanted changes or accidental deletion.

#### Measures to Protect Computer Security (Figure 9-13)

# Ethics

- New technologies create new opportunities and interactions,
  including new computer crimes for criminals and new cybercrime laws
  and ways to serve and protect for police officers. Therefore,
  computer ethics are guidelines for the morally acceptable use of
  computers in our society.
- Ethical treatment is important to all, including the right to keep
  personal information, such as credit ratings and medical histories,
  from getting into unauthorized hands.
- Three important issues in computer ethics for average users are
  cyberbullying, copyright and digital rights management, and net
  neutrality.

## Cyberbullying

- Cyberbullying is the use of the Internet to send or post content
  intended to hurt or embarrass another person, and it can lead to
  criminal prosecution.
- Examples of cyberbullying include sending unwanted e-mails, ganging
  up on victims in electronic forums, posting false statements,
  maliciously disclosing personal data, and sending any type of
  communication that is threatening or harassing.
- Cyberbullying is dangerous and hateful, and users should never
  participate in it or encourage others to do so.
- If someone is the victim of cyberbullying, they can get help and
  advice from [stopbullying.gov](https://www.stopbullying.gov/).

## Copyright and Digital Rights Management

- A **copyright** is a legal concept that gives content creators the right
  to control use and distribution of their work, including paintings,
  books, music, films, and video games.
- **Software piracy** is the unauthorized copying and/or distribution of
  software, and it costs the software industry over $60 billion
  annually.
- To prevent copyright violations, corporations use **digital rights
  management (DRM)** to control access to electronic media and files by
  limiting the number and kinds of devices that can access a file.
- However, some users feel they should have the right to use the media
  they buy as they choose, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
  makes it illegal to deactivate or disable any antipiracy
  technologies, including DRM technologies.
- It is also illegal to sell or use programs or devices that are used
  to illegally copy software, music, or videos from the Internet
  without appropriate authorization.
- Today, there are many legal sources for digital media, such as
  online stores and television-network-sponsored sites.

## Net Neutrality

- Net neutrality is the policy that **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**
  should deliver all data to customers at the same speed, regardless
  of the content.
- Opponents of net neutrality would allow ISPs to charge companies to
  deliver some websites faster, arguing that ISPs should be allowed to
  charge however they like.
- Proponents of net neutrality argue that the Internet has always had
  equal and unbiased access to information, and allowing ISPs to vary
  access to websites based on content is a new form of censorship.
- Net neutrality is an important defense of Internet freedom of
  speech, and it is important to prevent ISPs from discriminating
  against certain websites or users.

## Plagiarism

- Plagiarism means representing someone else\'s work and ideas as your
  own without giving credit to the original source, and computer
  technology has made plagiarism easier than ever.
- Cutting and pasting content from a web page into a report or paper
  is a common form of plagiarism.
- Services such as [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/) are dedicated to
  preventing Internet plagiarism by examining the content of a paper and
  comparing it to a wide range of known public electronic documents, including
  web page content.
- It is unethical and most likely illegal to copy parts of a web page
  from a variety of sites and combine them to form a term paper, and
  many schools and universities use plagiarism checking programs to
  compare the content of a student\'s paper to published material on
  the web and to previously submitted papers.

## Concept Check

- Ethics are guidelines for the morally acceptable conduct of
  individuals and organizations, while computer ethics are guidelines
  for the morally acceptable use of computers in our society.
- Copyright is a legal concept that gives content creators the right to control
  use and distribution of their work, while software piracy is the unauthorized
  copying and/or distribution of software. Digital rights management (DRM) is
  used to control access to electronic media and files, and the Digital
  Millennium Copyright Act makes it illegal to deactivate or disable any
  antipiracy technologies, including DRM technologies.
- Cyberbullying is the use of the Internet to send or post content intended to
  hurt or embarrass another person. It includes sending unwanted e-mails,
  ganging up on victims in electronic forums, posting false statements,
  maliciously disclosing personal data, and sending any type of communication
  that is threatening or harassing. Cyberbullying is dangerous and hateful, and
  users should never participate in it or encourage others to do so. If someone
  is the victim of cyberbullying, they can get help and advice
  from [stopbullying.gov](https://stopbullying.gov).
- Plagiarism means representing someone else's work and ideas as your own
  without giving credit to the original source. Computer technology has made
  plagiarism easier than ever, such as cutting and pasting content from a web
  page into a report or paper. Services such
  as [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/) are dedicated to preventing Internet
  plagiarism by examining the content of a paper and comparing it to a wide
  range of known public electronic documents, including web page content. It is
  unethical and most likely illegal to copy parts of a web page from a variety
  of sites and combine them to form a term paper, and many schools and
  universities use plagiarism checking programs to compare the content of a
  student's paper to published material on the web and to previously submitted
  papers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, as new technologies create new opportunities and interactions,
computer ethics are guidelines for the morally acceptable use of computers in
our society. Users should avoid cyberbullying and plagiarism, and respect
copyrights and digital rights management. Net neutrality is an important defense
of Internet freedom of speech, and ISPs should not be allowed to discriminate
against certain websites or users. It is important to reexamine our standards of
moral conduct, or ethics, in the context of these new opportunities and
interactions.
