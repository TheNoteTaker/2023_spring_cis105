# SLO 1.1 - Creating and Editing Business Documents

## Creating, Opening, and Saving Presentations

- Always save your presentation to avoid losing content.
- PowerPoint has AutoSave feature to continually save your work.
- Use the Start page to start a new presentation or open an existing one.
- You can create a blank presentation, a theme, or a template.
- To access only themes, click **Themes** in _Suggested searches_.

## PowerPoint Start Page, New, and Open Areas

- Launch PowerPoint to access the Start page.
- You can start a new blank presentation or open an existing one.
- You can also browse an online gallery for themes and templates.

#### HOW TO: Use the PowerPoint Start Page and New Areas

1. Launch PowerPoint to access the Start page.
2. Start a new blank presentation, a theme, or a template.
3. Search the online gallery for templates and themes.
4. Check for sample content to delete before adding your content.
5. Notice the theme or template name in the title bar until you name your
   presentation.

#### HOW TO: Use the PowerPoint Open Area

3. Click **OneDrive** or **This PC** to see the folders and files in these
   locations.
4. Click the presentation name to open it.
5. Click **Browse** to locate files using the Open dialog box.

## Views

- PowerPoint provides different views to help create, organize, and display
  slides.
- Normal view is the default view for creating slides.
- The Ribbon contains named tabs with commands organized in groups.

### Presentation Views

- **Normal View**: Default view for entering content and moving between slides.
- **Outline View**: Left pane displays slide titles and bulleted text.
- **Slide Sorter View**: Slides appear as thumbnails for easy reorganization and
  applying transition effects.
- **Notes Page View**: Each slide appears at the top of a page with space below
  for speaker notes.
- **Reading View**: Slide show displays at full-screen or another window size
  controlled by the viewer.

The Master Views group includes **Slide Master**, **Handout Master**, and *
*Notes Master**. These views are used to control the overall design and layout
of slides, handouts, and speaker notes.

The _Show_ group provides commands to control which elements display in a
presentation. The _Zoom_ group provides commands for enlarging or reducing the
view of the slide. The _Color/Grayscale_ group provides commands for changing
the color of the presentation while in various views. The _Window_ group
provides commands for controlling the view of multiple presentations or multiple
windows of the same presentation. The _Macros_ group provides commands for
creating and managing macros.

#### HOW TO: Change Views

1. Click the **View** tab on the **Ribbon**.

2. In the **Presentation Views** group, click the desired view command:

    - **Normal View**: Displays slide thumbnails on the left pane and the
      current slide on the right pane.

    - **Outline View**: Displays slide titles and bulleted text instead of slide
      thumbnails on the left pane.

    - **Slide Sorter View**: Displays all slides as thumbnails, making it easier
      to reorganize slides and apply transition effects.

    - **Notes Page View**: Displays each slide at the top of a page with space
      below the slide for speaker notes.

    - **Reading View**: Displays the slide show at full-screen or another window
      size controlled by the viewer, with navigation controls in the status bar
      at the bottom of the window.

3. Alternatively, use the **View** buttons on the **Status** bar at the bottom
   of the window to switch between views.

## Saving Presentations

When you save a presentation for the first time, you assign it a file name,
choose a file format, and select a location to store it. PowerPoint uses the
default file format, **.pptx**, which is compatible with PowerPoint 2007 and
later versions. If you want to save a presentation in a different file format,
click the **Save as type** arrow in the **Save As** dialog box and choose from
the available formats.

To save a presentation to your computer, click the **File** tab and then click *
*Save As**. In the **Save As** dialog box, navigate to the folder where you want
to save the presentation, type a file name in the **File name** box, and then
click **Save**.

#### HOW TO: Save a Presentation

1. Click the **File** tab to access **Backstage** view.

2. Click **Save As**.

3. In the **Save As** dialog box, navigate to the folder where you want to save
   the presentation.

4. Type a file name in the **File name** box.

5. Click the **Save as type** arrow and choose a file format if you want to save
   the presentation in a format other than the default **.pptx**.

6. Click **Save**.

#### TIP

Press **Ctrl+S** or click the **Save** button on the **Quick Access Toolbar** to
save changes to a presentation that has already been saved with a file name.

## File Management

To organize your files, create folders and subfolders to store related
documents. You can move, copy, rename, or delete files using **File Explorer**
in Windows or the **Save As** dialog box in PowerPoint.

#### HOW TO: Manage Files

1. Open **File Explorer** in Windows or the **Save As** dialog box in
   PowerPoint.

2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create a new folder.

3. Right-click in the folder, point to **New**, and then click **Folder**. Type
   a folder name and press **Enter**.

4. To move, copy, rename, or delete a file, right-click the file, and then
   choose the appropriate command from the context menu:

    - **Move**: Select the destination folder in the dialog box that appears,
      and then click the **Move** button to relocate the file.

    - **Copy**: Select the destination folder in the dialog box that appears,
      and then click the **Copy** button to create a duplicate of the file in
      the new location.

    - **Rename**: Type a new name for the file and press **Enter**.

    - **Delete**: Click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog box to permanently
      delete the file.

5. To move or copy multiple files at once, hold down the **Ctrl** key while
   clicking each file you want to select, then right-click one of the selected
   files and choose **Move** or **Copy** from the context menu.

6. To select a range of files, click the first file in the range, hold down the
   **Shift** key, and then click the last file in the range. Right-click one of
   the selected files and choose **Move** or **Copy** from the context menu.

## Closing and Exiting PowerPoint

When you finish working on a presentation, you can close it without exiting
PowerPoint. This is useful if you want to work on another presentation without
closing the program. To close a presentation, click the **File** tab and then
click **Close**. If you have not saved the presentation, a dialog box appears,
prompting you to save your changes.

To exit PowerPoint, click the **File** tab and then click **Exit**. If you have
not saved any open presentations, a dialog box appears, prompting you to save
your changes before exiting.

#### HOW TO: Close a Presentation or Exit PowerPoint

1. Click the **File** tab to access **Backstage** view.

2. To close a presentation, click **Close**. If you have not saved the
   presentation, a dialog box appears, prompting you to save your changes.

3. To exit PowerPoint, click **Exit**. If you have not saved any open
   presentations, a dialog box appears, prompting you to save your changes
   before exiting.

Now you have a basic understanding of how to navigate PowerPoint, change views,

# SLO 1.2 - Working with Slides, Layouts, Placeholders, and Text

## Overview

- Use placeholders in Normal view to enter slide text and other objects
- Add slides and choose layouts to provide a starting point for slide designs
- Enter text in placeholders and keep wording concise
- Use bullets and numbering to show items and subpoints
- Capitalize text as needed for titles

## Placeholders

- Rectangular boxes with no fill color or border
- Add color or resize a placeholder to fit content
- Available placeholders and positions are controlled by slide layout

### Starting a New Presentation

- First slide has a Title Slide layout with two placeholders: presentation title
  and subtitle
- Add text directly into placeholders or type slide text in Outline view
- Font, font size, and alignment are preset, but can be changed
- Text should be brief, straight to the point, and easy to read

### Adding Slides and Choosing Layouts

- Click the New Slide button on the Home tab to add a slide
- After a title slide, PowerPoint automatically inserts a Title and Content
  layout
- Each time you click the top of the New Slide button, you add a new slide with
  the same layout as the previous one
- Click the New Slide drop-down arrow to see a gallery of layouts
- Layouts provide a starting point for slide designs
- You can change layouts or customize each slide for the content you are
  developing
- Available layouts vary based on the current theme
- Table 1-2 lists common slide layout names and descriptions for each layout

## Text

- Enter text in placeholders by clicking on the inactive placeholder, which will
  become active with a blinking insertion point where you type or edit text
- Text will word wrap to begin another line if you enter text longer than the
  width of your placeholder
- Depending on the font used, title text for individual slides is usually 36–44
  points, and for a Title Slide layout, it is usually 54–72 points
- In body placeholders, a bullet automatically appears when you type text and
  press Enter
- Bulleted lists are appropriate when items require no certain order, but if you
  need to show items in order, use a numbered list instead
- Subpoints are indented below a bulleted item, and lists should be brief,
  usually no more than six items, and the text size is 20–28 points
- Larger font sizes are important if presenting in a large room, but if
  preparing a presentation to be viewed on a computer or online, a smaller font
  size is appropriate

## Tips

- Use Outline view to enter several text slides
- Decrease list level by moving a bulleted item to the left
- Convert a bulleted list to a numbered list by selecting the text to be changed
  and then clicking the Numbering button

## Aligning, Moving, and Resizing Placeholders in PowerPoint

### How to Align Text and Placeholders

- Horizontal alignment: Choose "Align Left," "Center," "Align Right," or "
  Justify" in the Home tab, Paragraph group. "Justify" should be used with
  caution because it can cause irregular spacing between words.
- Vertical alignment: Click "Align Text" in the Home tab, Paragraph group, and
  then choose "Top," "Middle," or "Bottom."

### How to Align Placeholders

- Select a placeholder and align it to the slide by clicking the Arrange button
  in the Home tab, Drawing group, and then choose "Align" or click the Align
  button in the Shape Format tab, Arrange group.
- When one placeholder is selected, "Align to Slide" is automatically selected.
- Horizontal alignment: Choose "Align Left," "Align Center," or "Align Right."
- Vertical alignment: Choose "Align Top," "Align Middle," or "Align Bottom."

### Moving and Resizing Placeholders

- Move a placeholder by pointing to its border so your pointer changes to a move
  pointer, click to select the placeholder, and drag it to a new position
  without changing its shape.
- To increase or decrease placeholder size, point to a corner or side sizing
  handle until your pointer changes to a resize pointer, and then drag to
  resize. You can also enter the exact dimensions in the Size group on the Shape
  Format tab.
- You can control the way placeholders and other objects are resized by pressing
  one of three keys as you drag.

### Editing Text in PowerPoint

- Commands for editing text are on the Home tab in three groups: Clipboard,
  Font, and Paragraph.
- When you point to text, your pointer changes to a text selection tool so you
  can click and drag to select text.
- To delete text, press "Delete" to remove text to the right of the insertion
  point or "Backspace" to remove text to the left of the insertion point. Select
  text and press "Delete" to remove several words at one time.
- To change text case, select the text to be changed, click the "Change Case"
  button in the Home tab, Font group, and then choose from the options "Sentence
  case," "lowercase," "UPPERCASE," "Capitalize Each Word," or "tOGGLE cASE."
- To change bullet symbols, select the text or placeholder where you want to
  change the bullet, click the "Bullets" drop-down arrow in the Home tab,
  Paragraph group, and then select "Bullets and Numbering" to open the Bullets
  and Numbering dialog box. From there, you can select one of the pre-defined
  bullets or choose a symbol from the Symbol dialog box.

### Using the Format Painter

- To copy multiple formatting changes from text, shapes, or pictures and apply
  these settings to another selection, use the Format Painter.
- To use the Format Painter, select the text or other object with the formatting
  changes that you want to copy, click the Format Painter button in the Home
  tab, Clipboard group, and then move the paintbrush over the text or other
  object you want to change and click to apply the formatting.

### Reusing Slides from Another Presentation

- To add slides from another presentation, click between two slides in the
  thumbnail pane where you want one or more new slides inserted, click the Reuse
  Slides button in the Home tab, Slides group, and then browse to the location
  where your presentation with the slides you need is saved and select the file
  name.
- By default, the slides you insert will appear with the formatting of the
  source presentation. If you want the slides you insert to match the formatting
  of the current presentation, uncheck the "Use source formatting" checkbox in
  the - Reuse Slides pane before inserting slides.
- Click the slides you want to insert in your current presentation.
- You can also click the "Insert Slide" link below each slide.
- Click the "Close" button at the top of the Reuse Slides pane.

#### Additional Information

- When task panes open, they are docked on the right side of the PowerPoint
  window. If you have a wide computer screen and you are using PowerPoint in a
  window size that does not fill the screen, drag a pane away from the window so
  your slide size becomes larger. Double-click the pane to dock it on the right
  of the window again.

## Notes on PowerPoint Tips and Tricks

### Check Spelling and Word Usage

- PowerPoint’s AutoCorrect feature repairs simple errors, and you can customize
  it to include words that you frequently misspell or abbreviate.
- PowerPoint adds a red, wavy line under unrecognized words.
- Use the Spelling feature to correct errors at any time, and use PowerPoint’s
  Thesaurus to find a more appropriate word.
- Carefully consider how Designer layouts emphasize slide content, and decide
  which of the layouts displayed is appropriate for your content.

#### How to Check Spelling

1. Click the Spelling button [Review tab, Proofing group].
2. The Spelling pane opens on the right.
3. Consider each identified word and whether or not the suggested spelling is
   correct.
4. Click the Audio button on the Spelling pane to hear the word pronounced.
5. Click the Change button to insert a suggested spelling, or click the Ignore
   Once or Ignore All button.
6. Click Change All to replace all incorrect words in the presentation with the
   correct spelling.
7. Click OK when the spell check is complete.

#### How to Use the Thesaurus

1. Click the word you want to change.
2. Click the Thesaurus button [Review tab, Proofing group].
3. The Thesaurus pane opens with the selected word in the search box.
4. Click a word in the list to see more options.
5. Click the down arrow to the right of a word in this list or right-click the
   word and choose Insert.
6. Click the Close button at the top of the Thesaurus pane.

### Use PowerPoint Designer with Listed Information

- The PowerPoint Designer feature provides a quick way to select attractive
  layouts.
- Write your bulleted or numbered lists so Designer makes relevant suggestions.
- Consider carefully how Designer layouts emphasize slide content.
- Variety in your slide designs can be good, but too many different elements
  will seem random and will not enhance the message of your presentation.

#### How to Use the Design Ideas Pane for Listed Information

1. Start a new presentation or open an existing one that uses one of
   PowerPoint’s themes.
2. Click the New Slide drop-down arrow [Home tab, Slides group] and select the
   Title and Content layout.
3. Type the title in the title placeholder.
4. Type the bulleted text.
5. The Design Ideas pane opens with thumbnails of different layouts.
6. If the Design Ideas pane does not automatically open, click the Design Ideas
   button [Design or Home tab, Designer group] to open the pane.
7. Scroll down to see all suggested layouts.
8. Click a thumbnail to apply it to your current slide.
9. Leave the Design Ideas pane open, and it will continue to generate design
   ideas as you develop other slides.
10. Close the Design Ideas pane by clicking the X at the top of the pane.
11. Reopen the Design Ideas pane at any time while you are developing a
    presentation.

#### How to Enable PowerPoint Designer

1. Click the File tab to open the Backstage view.
2. Click Options to open the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
3. Select the General tab and scroll down to the PowerPoint Designer heading.
4. Check Automatically show me design ideas.

### Use PowerPoint QuickStarter to Research Content

- PowerPoint QuickStarter can help you develop your presentation with both
  research and design ideas.
- QuickStarter provides an outline (in the form of slides) with suggested
  content and links to suitable articles and related images generated by a Bing
  search.

#### How to Enter a Topic and Select Slides

## Changing Theme Colors and Fonts

- In PowerPoint, you can change theme colors and fonts using the Design tab and
  the Slide Master tab.
- The Slide Master stores information about slide backgrounds, layouts, colors,
  and fonts for each theme.
- Theme and templates are provided by Microsoft and other companies.

### Types of Templates and Themes

- Theme: A slide show with background graphics and text treatments but no
  content. You can control design elements with the Slide Master to create
  custom designs.
- Template: A slide show with the characteristics of a theme but also with
  sample content on several slides. You can control design elements with the
  Slide Master to create custom designs.
- Template, title slide only: While the thumbnail may show a title slide, that
  slide might be the only content in the presentation. The Slide Master has not
  been used.
- Template, individual slide only: Thumbnails may show only a diagram or chart
  that can be revised for a new presentation. Usually, the Slide Master has not
  been used.
- Different slide sizes: PowerPoint’s default 16:9 aspect ratio, the ratio of
  width to height, is a wide-screen size which reflects the shape of current
  computer screens. A few thumbnails with an almost square appearance are shown
  in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which was the standard for many years.

### Change Theme Colors

- Select colors that are appropriate for your topic and consider where you will
  present.
- PowerPoint provides Variants on the Design tab that show different theme
  colors and may have different graphics.
- In each set of theme colors, the first four colors represent the background
  and text colors; the remaining six show accent colors.
- Not all themes you find online permit color changes in the same way.
- Click the More button (Design tab, Variants group) and select Background
  Styles to apply a light or dark variation of background and text colors.

### Change Theme Fonts

- Select fonts that are appropriate for your presentation topic.
- Consider how legible the font is with the background color you are using.
- Every presentation begins with a pair of Theme Fonts, the heading font, and
  the body font.
- Use the Design tab or the Slide Master tab to view or change Theme Fonts.

### Use the Slide Master to Change Theme Colors and Fonts

- The Slide Master tab enables you to change other design elements besides the
  background.
- Each Slide Master has a variety of layouts that control positioning of
  different types of content.
- Changes made on the first layout generally apply to all other layouts.

### Conclusion

- In PowerPoint, you can change theme colors and fonts using the Design tab and
  the Slide Master tab.
- Select colors and fonts that are appropriate for your presentation topic and
  consider where you will present.
- Use the Slide Master to customize other design elements such as background,
  logo, and layouts.

# SLO 1.5 - Inserting Headers and Footers

# SLO 1.7 - Creating and Editing Business Documents

## Applying and Modifying Transitions

- A **transition** is the visual effect of movement when one slide changes to
  the next slide.
- PowerPoint provides transition effects on the _Transitions_ tab in the
  _Transition to This Slide_ group.
- Each slide can have only one transition.
- Transitions can be set for one slide at a time in _Normal_ view or applied to
  all slides.
- Different transitions can be applied by selecting thumbnails in _Normal_ view
  or _Slide Sorter_ view and clicking a transition to apply it to those slides.
- The _Timing_ group has two options to control the slide transition:
    - _Advance Slide_ option _On Mouse Click_ enables the speaker to control
      timing.
    - _After_ option automates the transitions after a specified number of
      seconds.
- Duration, shown in seconds, controls how fast the slides change.
- Movement might be barely visible if the duration is fast; a slower duration of
  five or more seconds will cause the movement to be much more noticeable.
- Sound such as audio recording or music can be added to a transition that would
  play in the background as slides change.

### HOW TO: Apply Transitions

1. Select the slide thumbnail where you want a transition to appear.
2. Click the **Transitions** tab.
3. Click the **More** button to see additional transitions organized by the
   following categories: Subtle, Exciting, and Dynamic Content.
4. Apply one transition to all slides in the presentation by selecting a
   transition effect, selecting **On Mouse Click**, and clicking the **Apply to
   All** button.
5. Apply a different transition to selected slides by clicking the **Slide
   Sorter** button on the _Status_ bar, selecting a slide or pressing **Ctrl**
   as you click to select more than one slide, clicking a different transition
   effect to apply it to the selected slides, and selecting **On Mouse Click**
   if it is not already selected.
6. Preview slides in different views to test the movement.

## Effect Options

- **Effect Options** control the direction of transition movement.
- Each transition can have only one effect option, but most transitions provide
  two or more options from which to choose.
- Effect options can be applied as transitions are applied or later when editing
  the presentation.

### HOW TO: Select Effect Options

1. Select a slide with a transition.
2. Click the **Effect Options** button to see a drop-down list showing
   directional movements.
3. Select an effect option to apply it.
4. Apply the effect option to multiple transitions if appropriate by clicking *
   *Apply To All** if this movement is appropriate for all slides.
5. Preview the slides in _Slide Show_ view to test all transitions and effect
   options.

## Additional Tips

- It is neither practical nor advisable to apply different transitions to every
  slide in a presentation.
- Control movement skillfully to reinforce your message.
- Use the _Slide Sorter_ view to see more slides at once and decide which slides
  might benefit from a different movement.
- One of the transitions, **_Morph_**, works differently than other transitions
  because individual objects can appear to move as one slide changes into the
  next slide.
- Effect options can be applied to **_Morph_** transition.

# SLO 1.8 - Creating and Editing Business Documents

## Exploring Print Options

- Before printing, check your slides to ensure everything looks as you intended.
- PowerPoint provides convenient ways to preview and print presentation slides,
  handouts, notes pages, or outlines.

### Preview a Presentation

  page in your presentation as it will look when printed.
- Adjust slide or page size using the Zoom controls on the lower right side of
  the Status bar.
- The look of your slides in Backstage view is influenced by the selected
  printer.
- In Backstage view, select a printer from the available list of local and
  network printers.
- Settings are shown as buttons with the current setting displayed.

### Print a Slide

- The default print settings print each slide on letter-size paper.
- Adjust print settings as needed to print the current or selected slides.

### Print a Handout

- Handouts print one to nine slides on a page.
- Use these pages as audience handouts or for your own reference during a
  presentation.
- Select Scale to Fit Paper to increase slide size.
- Select Frame Slides to show a slide border, which is helpful when printing
  slides with a white background on white paper.
- Depending on the number of slides, changing the Page Orientation from Portrait
  to Landscape may increase slide size.
- When preparing handouts for an audience, consider which slides are important
  for the audience to have.
- You can specify which slides to include and reduce the number of pages
  required for printing.

### Print an Outline

- If a presentation consists of mostly slides with titles and bulleted lists,
  printing an outline is a very concise way to display the content.
- Only the text is shown.

## How to Print

- Click the File tab, Print button on the left.
- Select an appropriate printer.
- Click the list arrow on each button for a list of options:
    - Which Slides to Print: Print All Slides, Print Selection, Print Current
      Slide, or Custom Range using slide numbers entered in the Slides box such
      as slides 1-3 (a range of one through three) or slides 1-3, 5, 8 (a range
      followed by individual slides).
    - What to Print: Full Page Slides, Notes Pages, Outline, or Handouts.
    - Print Side: Print One Sided or Print on Both Sides. Choose Flip pages on
      long edge or Flip pages on short edge to control how pages will turn if
      they are bound together at the top or side like a book. However, not all
      printers can print on both sides, so you may not see these options.
    - Print Order: Collated and Uncollated.
    - Orientation: Landscape and Portrait. By default, slides print in landscape
      orientation and notes and handouts print in portrait orientation. This
      option is not available if you are printing full-size slides.
    - Color Range: Color, Grayscale, or Pure Black and White.
- Click the Edit Header & Footer link to open the Header and Footer dialog box
  to enter or revise information.
- Enter the number of copies if you need more than one.
- Click the Print button at the top.

## Useful Tips and Tricks

- Preview your slides in grayscale to confirm that all text is readable.
- You may need to adjust a few colors to get good results.

# SLO 1.9: Applying Properties

PowerPoint automatically records information called **properties** or **metadata
** that help manage and track files. These details, such as file size, creation
date, and number of slides, are not visible in the presentation but appear on
the Backstage view or the Properties dialog box. Other properties can be edited
by inserting your own content such as title and author.

## Adding Properties Using Backstage View

To add or edit properties:

1. Click the **File** tab to display the Backstage view.
2. Click **Info**.
3. Point to the property field names listed on the right. Properties that are
   automatically generated cannot be changed.
4. Click a text box to edit or add content. A red border displays when you point
   to a property text box.
5. Click **Show All Properties** to access additional information.
6. Click the **Back arrow** in the upper-left corner of the Backstage view to
   return to your presentation.

To access more properties, open the **Properties** dialog box by clicking the *
*Properties** button and selecting **Advanced Properties**. Properties are
organized in the following five tabs: General, Summary, Statistics, Contents,
and Custom. You can edit properties on the Summary tab.

**Note:** Properties can be viewed by others who use the presentation.

### Example:

- If you need to keep track of the version of a presentation, you can add a "
  Version" property and update it each time you make changes.
