# SLO 2.1: Working with Shapes, Styles, Effects, and Colors

- PowerPoint provides options through galleries, drop-down lists, and dialog
  boxes
- The Ribbon is dynamic and adapts to screen size
- The **More** button on a gallery shows the complete gallery
- The **Shapes** gallery can be found on the _Home_, _Insert_, and _Shape
  Format_ tabs
- Shapes are grouped into categories:
    - Recently Used Shapes
    - Lines
    - Rectangles
    - Basic Shapes
    - Block Arrows
    - Equation Shapes
    - Flowchart
    - Stars and Banners
    - Callouts
    - Action Buttons

## Shapes and Text Boxes

- Shapes can emphasize key points
- Different features can be used to draw and adjust shapes:
    - Crosshair: used to draw the shape
    - Sizing handles: used to change shape size
    - Rotation handle: used to angle shapes
    - Adjustment handle: used to change curves or points
- A text box can be used to add text anywhere on a slide without using
  placeholders

#### HOW TO: Draw One or More Shapes

1. Click the **Insert** tab
2. Click the **Shapes** button to display the _Shapes_ gallery
3. Select a shape in the _Shapes_ gallery and your pointer becomes a crosshair
4. Click and drag the crosshair on your slide to draw the shape
5. Resize or move the shape as necessary
6. To draw more than one of the same shape, right-click a shape in the _Shapes_
   gallery and click **Lock Drawing Mode**
7. Repeat to draw more of the same shape
8. Press **Esc** to turn off _Lock Drawing Mode_
9. To constrain a shape to keep horizontal and vertical dimensions the same,
   press **Shift** while you drag the crosshair on your slide

#### HOW TO: Change a Shape

1. Select the shape to be changed
2. Click the **Edit Shape** drop-down arrow on the _Shape Format_ tab, _Insert
   Shapes_ group
3. Select **Change Shape** and click a different shape from the _Shapes_ gallery
4. Click a blank area on the slide to deselect the shape
5. Click **Undo** on the _Home_ tab, _Redo_ group to return to your original
   shape

#### HOW TO: Draw a Text Box

1. Click the **Insert** tab
2. Click the **Text Box** button in the _Text_ group and your pointer changes to
   an insertion point
3. Create a text box using one of the following methods:
    - Click the slide background to place your insertion point where you want
      the text to appear
    - Click and drag to change the pointer to a crosshair and draw a text box
4. Resize and move the text box as necessary

#### Tips

- Press **Ctrl+D** to duplicate a selected shape
- Add text to shapes and format the text as you do with text in a placeholder
- A shape that you draw cannot be edited as you can shapes you draw with tools
  from the _Shapes_ gallery unless you convert your drawing to a shape
- If you want to use the drawing features and the _Draw_ tab is not displayed,
  click the **File** tab, select **Options**, and then check **Draw** on the
  right list to add that tab. Click **OK**

## Style Galleries and Effect Options

- Style galleries provide preset effects for shapes, pictures, and objects.
- You can customize all effects using the related buttons such as Shape Effects,
  Picture Effects, or Text Effects to access drop-down galleries.
- You can apply one or more effects without using styles from a gallery.
- The following are the Effect Options available in Table 2-1:

| Effect      | Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Customizing Colors

### RGB Color Model

- Typically used for computer displays
- Colors are formed by blending values of the three numbers for Red, Green, and
  Blue
- Highly saturated colors at the top have higher number values (255 maximum)
- Use these numbers to match color values in different shapes or objects such as
  a business or college logo

### Hex (Hexidecimal) Color Code

- Another way to define a color for computer display
- Generated from the numbers you enter for Red, Green, and Blue
- Often used by web designers because Hex color codes are supported in all
  browsers
- The Hex color is expressed in six numbers or letters with two each
  representing the intensity of red, green, or blue in the color

### Custom Tab

- Use this tab on the Colors dialog box to select a color more precisely
- Colors are arranged like a rainbow
- Drag a crosshair horizontally to select a different color
- Drag up or down to change the color intensity
- Move a slider to adjust how light or dark the color appears
- Drag up to add white and increase the luminosity
- Drag down to add black and decrease the luminosity
- Adjust the transparency as needed
- Click OK to apply the new color

### Eyedropper Tool

- Use this tool to create a Fill or Outline color in PowerPoint that exactly
  matches a color in a picture or other object
- The Eyedropper is a pointer that looks like a pen
- Click the Shape Fill drop-down arrow or Shape Format tab to select Eyedropper
- Move the pointer (now an eyedropper) around in the picture and a live preview
  of each color appears
- Click to select a color and it is applied to the selected shape
- Press Esc to cancel the Eyedropper without selecting a color

### Picture, Texture, or Pattern Fills

- You can fill shapes with more than colors
- Click the Shape Fill drop-down arrow on the Shape Format tab to select
  Picture, Texture, or Pattern Fills

- Browse or search for a picture and click Insert
- Select Texture from the drop-down list to open the gallery
- Click a texture to fill the shape or click More Textures to open the Format
  Shape pane
- Select Picture or texture fill and then click the Insert button to choose from
  the From a File, Stock Images, Online Pictures, or From Icons buttons to
  search for textures that are saved as a picture
- Select a shape and right-click to select Format Shape from the context menu to
  open the Format Shape pane
- Click Fill to display Fill options
- Select Pattern fill
- Click a pattern to fill the shape
- Change Foreground and Background colors as needed
- Click other patterns to see how different these colors look in different
  patterns

# SLO 2.6 - Creating a SmartArt Graphic

SmartArt graphics are a helpful tool for illustrating concepts such as
processes, cycles, or relationships in a clear manner, making it easy for the
audience to see connections and sequences.

## SmartArt Layouts

There are nine types of SmartArt graphic layouts available, which are organized
by type in the "Choose a SmartArt Graphic" dialog box. Each type serves a
specific purpose as outlined in Table 2-3:

| Type         | Purpose                                                                                   |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List         | Shows non-sequential or grouped information                                               |
| Process      | Displays sequential steps in a process or workflow                                        |
| Cycle        | Displays a continuing sequence or concepts related to a central idea                      |

| Relationship | Shows concepts that are connected such as contrasting, opposing, or converging            |
| Matrix       | Illustrates the relationship of four parts to the whole                                   |
| Pyramid      | Illustrates proportional or interconnected relationships                                  |
| Picture      | Shows pictures as integral parts of many different diagrams                               |
| Office.com   | Shows diagrams from layouts on Office.com                                                 |

When you select a layout, PowerPoint provides information about using that
specific layout. The SmartArt Design tab provides options for the overall layout
and styles of the SmartArt graphics, while the Format tab provides options to
customize shape and text styles, fill colors, outline colors, and effects.

## How to Create a SmartArt Graphic

You can create a SmartArt graphic using one of the following methods:

1. Create a new slide and click the Insert a SmartArt Graphic icon on the
   content placeholder.

2. Display the slide where you want to insert the SmartArt graphic and click the
   SmartArt button [Insert tab, Illustrations group].

3. Select a SmartArt type from the list on the left.

4. Click a layout in the gallery to select it.

5. Click OK to close the dialog box and insert the SmartArt graphic.

When you insert a SmartArt graphic using the SmartArt button on the Insert tab,
the initial size of the SmartArt frame may be different than if you inserted the
SmartArt graphic using the content placeholder on a new slide with a Title and
Content layout. You may need to resize the frame for your content to fit
appropriately on your slide.

If the layout you choose has picture placeholders on the shapes, click each
picture icon to open the Insert Pictures dialog box. Choose from the options
available to locate the picture you want to use and click Insert. The picture is
sized automatically and shaped to fit the current picture placeholder.

### Adding Text

Click the Text Pane button [SmartArt Design tab, Create Graphic group] to open a
pane beside your layout. As you type in the pane, SmartArt text appears as a
bulleted list and in the SmartArt shapes on the slide. Text becomes smaller in
the shapes as you enter more text, so it is important to use only a few words.
You can resize or move the Text pane.

Alternatively, you can type directly into each SmartArt shape. Text resizes as
you type so be concise to avoid text becoming too small for easy reading.
Pressing Tab does not move your insertion point between shapes. You can paste
copied text, but you cannot drag text into a SmartArt shape.

If you already have bulleted text on your slide, you can quickly change that
text to a SmartArt graphic. Select the bulleted text placeholder or click
anywhere in the placeholder that you want to convert to a SmartArt graphic, and
then click the Convert to SmartArt Graphic button [Home tab, Paragraph group].
The gallery displays layouts for listed information. Click a layout to apply it.
Alternatively, you can click More SmartArt Graphics to open the Choose a
SmartArt Graphic dialog box, select from all layouts, and then click OK to close
the dialog box and insert the SmartArt graphic.

List layouts often work well if you have two levels of bulleted text: Level 1 (
the first line) and Level 2 (text indented to a sublevel). The two levels of
text are arranged differently based on the selected SmartArt layout.

# SLO 2.8 - Creating a Chart

## Creating a Chart

- Charts help viewers interpret and compare data.
- For most situations, PowerPoint’s Chart feature will provide all the options
  you need.
- If you have large amounts of data, create your chart in Excel and copy it to a
  PowerPoint slide.

### How to Insert a Chart

- Click the Insert Chart icon on a new slide content placeholder or click the
  Insert tab and click the Chart button [Illustrations group] to add a chart to
  an existing slide.
- Choose a chart type to control how data is represented such as in columns,
  bars, lines, or pie slices.
- When you insert a chart in PowerPoint, a worksheet opens with sample data in
  rows and columns. A group of data values from each column is a data series; a
  group of data values from each row is a category.

### Chart Types and Purposes

- There are 17 chart types, including Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, X Y (
  Scatter), Map, Stock, Surface, Radar, Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Box &
  Whisker, Waterfall, Funnel, and Combo.
- Chart types and their purposes are described in Table 2-5.

### Editing Data in the Worksheet

- After you replace the worksheet sample data with your data, you can close the
  worksheet.
- You can open the worksheet again if you need to make changes.
- To modify the data in Excel, click the Edit Data drop-down arrow and choose
  Edit Data in Excel to open Excel and display the worksheet.
- Because the worksheet and PowerPoint chart are linked, the changes you make to
  the worksheet are automatically reflected in the chart.

### Chart Elements and Definitions

- The chart elements vary based on the type of chart used.
- Chart elements are defined in Table 2-6.

### Modifying the Worksheet

- You can adjust column width, add or delete columns and rows, and use Excel to
  modify data.

### Change Chart Type

- Click the Change Chart Type button [Chart Design tab, Type group] to open the
  Change Chart Type gallery where you can choose from the many different
  layouts.

## Conclusion

PowerPoint's Chart feature provides all the options you need to create a chart.
It allows you to choose from different chart types, edit data in the worksheet,
adjust chart elements, and change chart types. PowerPoint makes it easy to
create, edit, and modify charts, making it an efficient tool for presentations.

# Formatting a Chart

## PowerPoint's Designer Feature

- Designer feature suggests different slide layouts for charts
- Layouts in the Design Ideas pane show several slide background designs with
  the chart positioned differently
- Best to apply one of these layouts before customizing the chart
- Office 365/2021 Note: The PowerPoint Designer feature may not be available in
  all versions of Office 365 or Office 2021.

## Chart Styles and Colors

- Chart Styles gallery provides preset effects for chart elements, including the
  chart background
- Click the More button to see styles arranged by number
- Click a style to apply it
- Click the Change Colors button to select Colorful or Monochromatic
  combinations
- The colors should coordinate with the overall presentation
- Avoid arranging red and green colors together because people who have
  difficulty recognizing colors are more likely to have problems with red and
  green colors because they can look beige or gray

## Format Chart Elements

- Select chart elements and apply formatting in several ways
- When a chart element is selected, the related options for that element display
  when the Format pane opens
- Format shapes by clicking the Shape Fill, Shape Outline, or Shape Effects
  drop-down arrows
- Format text by clicking the Text Fill, Text Outline, or Text Effects drop-down
  arrows
- To change the size of the entire chart, the Chart Area, point to any sizing
  handle and resize by dragging
- You can fill a Chart Area or a Plot Area with a picture to create an
  interesting background
- Be careful that text is easy to read on the picture and simplify the chart as
  much as possible
- Vary colors to feature certain chart elements or to make text easy to read

## Legend and Data Labels

- The legend is usually displayed on the right, but you can move it to other
  positions, display it horizontally above or below the plot area, or delete it
- The colors used to identify each data series must always be easy to interpret
  and compare
- If you have only one data series, no legend is needed
- Data labels display values for each data series
- Use the Format Data Labels pane to customize labels
- A pie chart has one data series
- Each slice represents a value and the size of the slice illustrates its
  relationship to the whole
- Data labels are often used instead of a legend because they are easier to
  interpret
- Format data labels to display on the slices or outside the slices

## Explode a Pie Slice

- You can explode (separate) pie chart slices by dragging the pie slices away
  from the center
- When all slices are separated, no single slice is emphasized
- Design a pie chart as you want it to look and then drag one slice away from
  the pie to emphasize that slice
