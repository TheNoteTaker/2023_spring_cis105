# SLO 3.1 - Creating Custom Theme Colors and Background Fills

## Importance of Themes

- Themes create a unified appearance for your presentation
- Effective use of themes presents information on a topic as a cohesive package
- Matching specific colors in a company logo or a school’s college colors is
  possible with themes

## Custom Theme Colors

- PowerPoint automatically applies theme colors to various graphics
- Selected theme colors are arranged across the top of the Theme Colors gallery
- Various percentages of each color appear below the top row colors
- Accent colors appear from left to right in both the Shape Styles gallery and
  the Table Styles gallery
- Creating custom theme colors boosts productivity
- Custom colors are available to use again in another presentation
- Design tab can be used to quickly select built-in theme colors
- Creating custom themes with specific colors may be more appropriate for
  certain topics

## Creating New Theme Colors

1. Start a new presentation using a design theme or open an existing
   presentation.
2. Click the More button [Design tab, Variants group].
3. Select Colors to open the list of built-in theme colors.
4. Select Customize Colors to open the Create New Theme Colors dialog box.
5. Change individual colors as needed to create your custom theme.
6. Click a Color button to open the Theme Colors gallery of preset Theme Colors.
7. Select a different theme color or click More Colors to open the Colors dialog
   box.
8. Click the Standard or Custom tab, choose a color, and click OK.
9. Repeat for each of the colors you want to change.
10. Name the new custom theme.
11. Click the Save button.
12. The new custom theme is automatically applied.
13. The name will appear in the Custom section of your list of available theme
    colors so you can use it again.

## Background Fills

- Pattern, gradient, and picture fills can be applied to slide backgrounds
- Issues to keep in mind when applying these fills to slide backgrounds:
    - Consider colors that contrast well with the text
    - Avoid using too many graphics that may detract from the content

## Additional Tips

- Colors influence the tone or mood of your presentation
- Be respectful of cultural differences when choosing colors
- People assign meaning to colors based on their cultural background and life
  experiences
- Online resources are available to examine the concept of color meaning, color
  symbolism, or the psychology of color

## Changing Background Colors

- When you change background colors, text colors do not change, and the position
  of placeholders or the graphic shapes that appear on design themes do not
  change.
- Choose colors and creative effects for backgrounds carefully, as they will
  fill the entire slide area behind everything else you design on a slide.
- If you apply them to all slides, you should examine your changes at full
  screen size to be sure you are satisfied with the results.
- If a theme or template has graphic shapes included in its design, then a solid
  color background fill is a good choice. Select a color that has a strong
  contrast from the color used for text (light on dark or dark on light).

## Formatting Background with Pattern and Gradient Fills

### Pattern Fills

- Two colors (the Foreground and the Background) create pattern fills. Two
  similar colors create a subtle pattern, while two contrasting colors create a
  more obvious pattern.
- To add a pattern fill, point to and right-click the slide background to open
  the context menu, click Format Background to open the Format Background pane,
  select the Pattern fill option, choose an appropriate Foreground Color and
  Background Color, choose one of the patterns, and click Apply to All to apply
  this change to the entire presentation.
- You can reset the background's original design by clicking the Reset
  Background button.

### Gradient Fills

- Preset gradient colors are based on theme colors.
- To add a gradient fill, point to the slide background that you want to change
  and right-click to open the context menu, click Format Background to open the
  Format Background pane, select the Gradient fill option, click the Preset
  gradients button and select a color from the gallery of options, choose the
  Type of gradient that controls how the colors blend, and then choose the
  Direction of color change.
- You can change colors by selecting a gradient stop and clicking the Color
  button. Choose a different color, or adjust brightness and transparency as
  needed.
- You can add or remove gradient stops and change percentages for each stop
  position to precisely adjust the positions.
- You can reset the background's original design by clicking the Reset
  Background button.

## Formatting Background with Picture and Texture Fills

### Picture Fills

- Pictures help you tell your story, communicate without words, and convey
  emotions that are difficult to express in words.
- To add a picture fill, point to and right-click the slide background to open
  the context menu, click Format Background to open the Format Background pane,
  select the Picture or texture fill option, and choose one of the buttons to
  select and insert a picture.
- You can soften the picture colors so text and other objects on the slide are
  easy to see by increasing the transparency percentage on the Format Background
  pane or changing the saturation levels or accent colors for a monochromatic
  effect.
- You can also use a picture multiple times in a small size to fill the
  background.

### Texture Fills

- Textures can use many colors or show a lot of detail, and it is generally best
  to tile them because the effect is more pleasing.
- If the textures are too bold or blurred when stretched to fill a slide, you
  can adjust the Tiling Options and reduce the Scale percentage to display each
  image in a smaller size. Offset points control how much the tiled images are
  indented from the left and top.
- Textures available on the Format Background pane are small images.

# SLO 3.2 - Applying Animation

## Animation

- Movement of objects on a slide.
- Creates a dynamic presentation.
- Can help audience focus on concepts.
- Observe creative animation techniques from movies and TV commercials.
- Select movements that enhance content and support message.
- Use animation sparingly to avoid distracting audience.
- Consider transitions (movement between slides) when planning movement.

## Types of Animation Effects

- **Entrance**: Movement that occurs when an object appears on the slide (
  green).
- **Emphasis**: Movement or color change that calls attention to an object that
  remains on the slide (yellow).
- **Exit**: Movement that occurs when an object leaves the slide (red).
- **Motion Path**: Predefined movements or one a user draws to make an animated
  object move in a specific direction.

Note: Certain effects are for text only. When animating objects, those effects
are gray in the gallery and are not available.

## Applying Effects

- Select an animated object and click the **Animation Painter** button to copy
  those settings.
- Click a second object to apply the same animation settings to that object.

## Effect Options, Timing, and Duration

- Each animation has **_Effect Options_** that control the direction of
  movement.
- Viewers cannot read text until it stops moving, so be careful when applying
  animation to text.
- Adjust animation **Timing** using the following commands:
    - **Start**: When the _On Click_ option is selected, the speaker controls
      when animation begins by clicking at an appropriate time. The _With
      Previous_ or _After Previous_ options cause the animation to occur
      automatically.
    - **Duration**: By default, the time to complete each animation ranges from
      .50 to 2.00 seconds depending on the movement. Increasing the duration
      seconds extends the time an object is moving so the movement appears
      slower.
    - **Delay**: The default setting is no delay, but enter seconds to start the
      animation after a specified time.
    - **Reorder Animation**: When multiple objects are animated, click **Move
      Earlier** or **Move Later** to adjust the sequence of animation.
- Check animation numbers to be sure the sequencing is appropriate. Each number
  represents the click on which the animation occurs.
- Timing animation enables automatic revealing of each object without clicking
  to advance.

## Conclusion

- Animation is a powerful tool that can add dynamism to a presentation and help
  focus the audience's attention.
- Use animation sparingly and thoughtfully to avoid distracting viewers.
- Take into account the context and content of the presentation when selecting
  animation effects, and always consider the timing and duration of the
  animations.

# SLO 3.3 - Using an Online Video

## Using an Online Video

and add another dimension to your message.
However, it is important to be aware of copyright laws and obtain permission
before using a video for business purposes.
To link a presentation to an online video, copy the video's URL and paste it
into PowerPoint.
Then, format the video, reposition it on the slide, and apply styles to enhance
its appearance.
Finally, test the video to ensure it plays correctly and obtain permission
before using it for business purposes.

# SLO 3.4 - Using Rehearsal Techniques

## Using Rehearsal Techniques

- Practicing presentation delivery ensures that each slide’s information
  supports what you are saying.
- Rehearsal builds confidence and helps to reduce nervousness.

## Speaker Notes

- Speaker notes help you remember what you need to say in your presentation.
- Speaker notes should not be written as a script.
- Write notes as personal reminders, such as items to emphasize or terminology
  to define.
- Plan for smooth and logical transitions between topics.
- Having speaker notes available during a presentation can be comforting.

### How to Use Notes Page View

- Click the Notes Page button [View tab, Presentation Views group] to show the
  slide at the top of a page with a large text box below.
- Type your notes in the text box.
- Increase the font size before printing to make notes easier to see on a
  lectern or podium.
- Omit the Frame Slides option for Notes Pages.
- Printed handouts with handwritten reminders can work well for speaker notes.

### How to Print Notes Pages

- Click the File tab and click Print.
- Choose Notes Pages for Print Layout and check Scale to Fit Paper to make the
  slide images larger.
- Omit the Frame Slides option for Notes Pages.
- Click the Print button.

## Rehearse Timings

- PowerPoint’s Rehearse Timings feature makes it easy to judge the pace of your
  presentation.
- Practice what you will say while each slide displays.
- Use printed notes pages while practicing.
- The time spent on each slide is recorded as you move through the presentation.
- The times appear below each slide in Slide Sorter view.

### How to Rehearse Timings

- Click the Rehearse Timings button [Slide Show tab, Set Up group] to start the
  slide show.
- A Recording dialog box appears in the upper-left corner. It shows the time
  each slide displays and the total elapsed time.
- Click the Next Slide button (or press the spacebar) to advance.
- Click the Pause or Repeat buttons as needed.
- Click Yes when asked at the end of the presentation if you want to save your
  timings.
- Click the Slide Sorter button [Status bar] to see the timings, in seconds,
  displayed below each slide.
- Stand to replicate more closely the experience you will have when speaking to
  your audience.

### Set Timings Manually

- You can enter all timings manually, but it is quicker to rehearse the
  presentation, save the timings, and adjust the time as needed for individual
  slides.
- Save the timings to automate the presentation if it is self-running.
- If you are presenting to an audience, do not use the timings so you control
  when the slides advance.

### How to Modify Timings

- Click the Normal View button [View tab, Presentation Views group], if you are
  in another view.
- Click the Transitions tab and be sure the After option is
  selected [Transitions tab, Timing group].
- Change the number of seconds for each slide, as needed, to increase or
  decrease the amount of time the slide displays.
- Deselect the On Mouse Click option if you want the slides to advance
  automatically.
- Present your slide show without using the saved timings by deselecting the Use
  Timings option [Slide Show tab, Set Up group].
- Remove timings by clicking the Record Slide Show
  button [Slide Show tab, Set Up group], select Clear, and then select Clear
  Timing on Current Slide or Clear Timings on All Slides.

## Rehearse with Presenter Coach

- Presenter Coach helps you become a better speaker by providing feedback on
  your delivery.
- It uses artificial intelligence to identify issues that need improvement as
  you rehearse a presentation.
- Presenter Coach identifies issues such as reading from slides, using
  repetitive language, talking too fast, or saying filler words such as “uhm.”
- It offers solutions for improvement and compliments the speaking
  characteristics that you do well.
- You need a microphone or a microphone-enabled device and an Internet
  connection to use this feature.
- Presenter Coach is available to Microsoft 365 subscribers running the Current
  Channel Version.

### How to Use Presenter Coach

- Open a presentation to rehearse.
- Click the Rehearse with Coach button [Slide Show tab, Rehearse group].
- Click Start Rehearsing.
- Begin your presentation and discuss content as you would in a “live” delivery
  to an audience.
- During the rehearsal, you will receive real-time prompts.
- Press Esc to exit the slide show.
- Review the Rehearsal Report that automatically appears.
- After considering the issues that Presenter Coach identified, include
  reminders in your Notes Pages.
- Rehearse the presentation again and try to improve your results.

## Prepare for Mishaps

- Be sure to have backup copies of your presentation in case you experience
  equipment failure and need to switch to a different computer.
- In a worst-case situation, where both your computer and projector have
  malfunctioned, present using your handouts to support what you say.
- Experienced presenters encounter such problems during their careers.

# SLO 3.5 - Controlling Display Options

## Controlling Display Options

- PowerPoint 365 and 2021 default size is Widescreen, whereas the default size
  before PowerPoint 2013 was Standard.
- Slide show designed in the 16:9 aspect ratio (the ratio of width to height)
  fills the screen to take advantage of this wide horizontal space.
- Slide show designed in the 4:3 aspect ratio displayed on a widescreen will be
  positioned in the center of the screen with black areas on both sides.
- Standard (4:3) and Widescreen (16:9) slide sizes are available on the Design
  tab in the Customize group.

### HOW TO: Change the Slide Size

  or more monitors.
- Using Presenter View while speaking is helpful.
- The primary monitor shows your view of the presentation and includes the
  displayed slide, the navigation tools, the next slide, and an area for notes.
- The second monitor (or projector) displays the full-size slide show for your
  audience.

### HOW TO: Use Presenter View

- View your notes for the current slide while displaying the full-size slide
  show for your audience.
- Use pen and laser pointer tools to emphasize points on your slide.

# SLO 3.6 - Presenting Using Projection Equipment

## Presenting Using Projection Equipment

- Ideal location for a speaker is to the left of the projection screen.
- Be flexible when you cannot control the speaker area.
- Keep cables and cords away from the area where you and audience members walk
  or tape cords to the floor for safety.

## Position Equipment

- Verify that your devices will connect to the projector or television before
  your scheduled presentation time.
- In presentation rooms, you may need to place your computer on a table.
- Be careful that the podium does not create a barrier between you and the
  audience.
- Move away from the podium when possible.

## Navigate in a Slide Show

- Methods to advance, to go to specific slides, or to end a slide show.
- During a presentation, blank the screen by pressing B on your keyboard to
  display an empty black screen or W to display an empty white screen.
- Hide a slide when you have information that is not essential to your
  presentation.
- Keyboard shortcuts are convenient if you have easy access to your keyboard
  while speaking.

## Remote Control and Laser Pointer

- Remote control devices come in many styles from small clickers to clickers
  that resemble pens with USB storage.
- Remote controls may have a built-in laser pointer or purchase a separate
  pointing device.
- A dot on the screen directs audience attention to a particular location.

### How to: Change Laser Pointer Color

- Click the Set Up Slide Show button to open the Set Up Show dialog box.
- Click the Laser pointer color list box arrow and select red, green, or blue.

# SLO 3.7 - Drawing on Slides During a Presentation

## Drawing on Slides During a Presentation

- Call attention to information during a presentation by writing or drawing on
  slides with the Pen in Slide Show view.
- The pen tool works differently than the pen tools available on the Draw tab
  that can be used in Normal view while developing the presentation.
- Consider the context of the tool as you explore its use.

### Using the Pen Tool

- Controlling the pen to write with a hand-held mouse can be awkward.
- Using a finger, a stylus, or digital pen to draw on a touch screen is more
  natural.
- You can record audience feedback and make simple drawings to emphasize or show
  connections.
- The default pen color is red, but it can be changed to another color for
  better contrast with the slide background.
- Select different options using a context menu or from a button in the control
  area on the lower left of the slide.
- Pen tools are available in Presenter View, and options can be controlled with
  keyboard shortcuts.

#### How to Use the Pen Tool

1. Start a slide show and go to the slide you want to annotate.
2. Select the Pen using one of the following methods:
    - Click the Pen button in the control area on the lower left to open the
      context menu. Select an option.
    - Right-click anywhere on the slide to open the context menu and select
      Pointer Options. Select an option.
3. Begin writing or drawing on one or more slides.
4. To remove markings, right-click, select Pointer Options from the context
   menu, and select Eraser. With the Eraser, click markings to delete each
   continuous pen stroke.
5. To change ink color, right-click, select Pointer Options from the context
   menu, and select the Ink Color option. Select a different color.
6. Click Keep at the end of a presentation to save ink annotations. The markings
   are saved as lines that you can edit.

### Using the Highlighter

- To add a color overlay on slide text, use the Highlighter just as you would
  mark text to highlight information on paper.
- These notes or drawings are called ink annotations.
- Use the Eraser to remove annotations.

## Ink Markup Shortcuts

- During a slide show, pen tools can be controlled with keyboard shortcuts.
- Table 3-6 lists the ink markup shortcuts.

### Table 3-6: Ink Markup Shortcuts

This table shows keys to press for 4 shortcuts used during a slide show to mark
up a slide.

| Press  | Action                            |

# SLO 3.8 - Preparing a Self-Running Presentation

##     

- A self-running slide show, also known as a kiosk presentation, runs
  continuously without someone being present to advance the slides.
- It works well for trade shows or open house events where people walk up to a
  computer screen and watch the slide show.
- Self-running presentations can be used for marketing products to customers or
  to educate patients in medical office waiting rooms.
- You can record narration to accompany the slides or create a slide show to
  loop so it cycles continuously from beginning to end and automatically
  repeats.

### Record a Slide Show with Narration

- Computer must have a microphone, sound card, and speakers to record voice
  narration.
- You can record yourself speaking with a camera.
- It helps you practice what you will say during a presentation and evaluates
  your vocal qualities.
- Use notes pages or other resources as references.
- While narrating, PowerPoint records your use of the pen, highlighter, or
  eraser.
- You can stop and listen to your recording, and if you're not satisfied,
  re-record over the first version.
- Audio and ink annotations are removed when you begin a new recording.

#### HOW TO: Record Narration

1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Open the Recording window using one of these methods:
    - Click the top of the Record Slide Show button [Set Up group] to start
      recording on the current slide.
    - Click the Record Slide Show drop-down arrow [Set Up group] and then select
      Record from Current Slide or Record from Beginning.

13. Save your presentation.

#### ANOTHER WAY

- The Record Slide Show button is also available on the Recording tab and has
  the same options.
- Use PowerPoint Options to add the Recording tab to your Ribbon.
- The audio (and video if a camera is used) is embedded on each slide and,
  therefore, synchronized with timings for how long each slide displays in the
  presentation.
- Review your presentation in Slide Show view.
- Press Esc if you need to end the slide show before reaching the last slide.
- Edit your recordings if necessary.
- You can re-record individual slides within the presentation or change
  sequencing.
- You may notice unnecessary audio at the end of a recording. When that happens,
  reduce the After seconds [Transitions tab, Timing group] to “trim” seconds so
  the recording is automatically interrupted as you transition to the next
  slide.
- Remove a single narration by deleting the slide audio or web cam icon or clear
  timing and narration on all slides.
- Once your presentation is complete, save your narrated slide show to a CD, a
  flash drive, or share it online as a presentation or even a video.

### Clear Timings or Narration

1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Record Slide Show drop-down arrow [Set Up group] and then select
   Clear.
3. Select from these options:
    - Clear Timing on Current Slide

    - Clear Narration on Current Slide
    - Clear Narration on All Slides.
4. To display a narrated slide show without narration or timings, deselect Play
   Narrations and Use Timings [Slide Show tab, Set Up group].
5. You can also make this change when you set up a show. Click the Set Up Show
   button [Slide Show tab, Set Up group], and select Show without narration
   under Show Options and Manually under Advance Slides.

## Set Up a Kiosk Presentation with Looping

- Depending on how you plan to use a kiosk presentation, it may need different
  design guidelines than a slide show that is projected by a presenter.
- While other presentations provide minimal text because slides support the
  speaker’s message, a kiosk presentation may contain more information because
  it is a stand-alone product.
- If your kiosk presentation is displayed in a public place with distractions,
  use splashy graphics to grab attention.
- On the other hand, if your kiosk presentation is for educational purposes in a
  quiet setting such as a doctor’s office, the slides might be designed more
  like pages in a book with smaller text and more detailed information.

#### HOW TO: Set Up a Kiosk Presentation

1. Click the Slide Show tab.
2. Click the Set Up Slide Show button [Set Up group] to open the Set Up Show
   dialog box.
3. Choose the following settings:
    - Show type: Browsed at a kiosk (full screen).
    - Show options: Loop continuously until 'Esc' is automatically selected and
      grayed out because you chose a kiosk.
    - Show slides: All or enter the first and last slide numbers you want to
      display.
    - Advance slides: Use timings, if present is automatically selected for a
      kiosk.
    - Slide show monitor: If you are using more than one monitor, select the
      appropriate monitor for the slide show.
    - Resolution: Use Current Resolution or the highest resolution possible for
      your equipment.
    - Use Presenter View is not available for a kiosk presentation.
4. Click OK.
5. Save the presentation with these changes.

## Conclusion

In summary, PowerPoint allows you to prepare and deliver self-running
presentations that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as marketing
products, educating patients in medical offices, or displaying information in
public places. You can record voice narration for your presentation and loop it
so it cycles continuously from beginning to end and automatically repeats.
Additionally, you can set up a kiosk presentation with looping, different design
guidelines, and resolutions. By following the steps and guidelines presented in
this chapter, you can create effective and engaging self-running presentations.
